		message.channel.send('A distant humming filled the empty streets of the old, abandoned city, singing an old tune from hundreds of years before. The deep footsteps in thick, heavy snow made a soft thud that echoed across the otherwise silent, lifeless streets, rebounding from window to window. A bright light came from the hand of the man who made these noises, coming from an old, rusty flashlight, tightly strapped to his revolver, which made a small path through the seemingly infinite black ink of darkness, lighting up whatever lied in front of it. The man was hardly visible in the overcasting shadow of night; the only noticeable features being his tall, muscular build, and his menacing cape, which dangled down to the ground, sliding slowly across the snow, alongside a large, dark hood, that hid anything   that could have been seen on his face, even in the darkness. He looked like an adventurer, an explorer, someone who was searching for some unknown treasure he desired, but it was very clear that, if one could see the mans face under his secretive hood and the shroud of darkness, he had a destination in mind. He didn’t have the look of a mercenary, though he wore similar clothing. The look in his eyes proved otherwise: he was set on something, a goal, a mission, a destiny, and to him, there was no wall he couldn’t climb that would stop him from reaching that destiny.');
	  	message.channel.send('He walked into an old subway station, the walls rusted by time, yellowed and dusty, falling apart and peeling. One of the walls had crumbled down, leaving nothing but the metal supports and the frame behind it, of which had rusted, some of it collapsed. The station was fragile, it had seen countless years and countless battles. There was a massive door blocking his entry to the station, it’s metal somewhat clean and well kept, unlike the rest of the station, and it was tied together by a mix of bolts, screws, and tape. On the middle there was a large insignia: a red rectangle with three white swords; the flag of the Republic. It appeared crude, but it served it’s purpose. He put his gun quickly into his holster, turning off its flashlight, then raised his hand and pounded it on the door.');
    		message.channel.send('The door began to creak, dust and frosted snow coming out of it as the gate opened. The lights inside were almost blinding compared to the darkness that remained outside the station, and the shadow of a man, clearly a guard of the station, was cast down on the adventurer, openly pointing his double-barrel shotgun at him.');
    		message.channel.send('"What are you doin’ here, old man?" the guard said in a very serious manner, speaking in a voice so deep it almost seemed fake, almost as though he was trying to assert dominance over the adventurer.');
    		message.channel.send('"I am on official business with the Aeternum Republic, here to see Doctor Cassius Devitt," the man replied swiftly and sharply.');
    		message.channel.send('"The Plague Doctor? What for? Who sent you?" the guard responded with anger, believing the adventurer was nothing more than a fake and a liar. He responded with nothing, instead pulling a small piece of paper out of his pocket, gesturing it towards the guard. He took it fiercely with one hand, keeping the other on the shotgun pointed at the man, acting as though he were about to rip the sheet in half. The guard stared at the paper for a moment, then looked up from the paper directly at the adventurer, then back down at the paper. He growled angrily, clearly showing his teeth, and frowned at the man.');
    		message.channel.send('“Authority to see the Doctor from the Executor himself… fine. Come with me,” the guard handed the adventurer back his paper, who then proceeded to put it back into his pocket. The guard held his shotgun at his side and began to walk the man through the station.');
    		message.channel.send('“You’re the first man to come see him in a while. He might not be so… sociable,” the guard explained to him, looking forward, keeping his eyes off the adventurer out of hatred, possibly even out of fear.');
    		message.channel.send('“I’ve dealt with worse.”');
    		message.channel.send('“If you don’t mind me asking, what business do are you here to see him about?”');
    		message.channel.send('“I do mind you asking.”');
    		message.channel.send('People were somewhat scarce at the station, most appeared to only be passing through, coming onto the platform itself to make their way into the tunnel on the opposite side, or to trade with one of the very few salesmen who made a living off of the trade there. There was one of these that caught the adventurer’s eye for a moment: a man standing behind one of these market stands, middle aged and in a bad state of health, with a large scar coming down from the top of his forehead all the way to the top of his lip, completely covering one eye and rendering it useless. Two guards appeared in front of his stand suddenly, both with large guns drawn. They began screaming at the old man, but the old man almost completely ignored them.');
    		message.channel.send('“…if you don’t pay up right now… we have orders on the behalf of the Republic to seize tax…” the guards shouted at him. Much to their surprise, the old man came back with just the same force, but his was not shown in words. Instead, he reached under his cabinet for something. The guards most likely thought it was the money he had to pay, but the old man would much rather die than let the guards take from him again.');
    		message.channel.send('Like a quick flash of light, he whipped out a pistol and killed one of the guards in front of him, square in between the eyes. A good shot for a man his age. He took the gun and pointed it at the other and pulled the trigger. An empty click. The remaining guard simply laughed at the old man, and raised his gun at him. The adventurer turned away quickly, as in spite of all the things he had seen, he still couldn’t stand to see a poor old man suffer such a fate as this. The gunshot thundered across the station, echoing across it’s aging halls and into the tunnels.');
    		message.channel.send('The adventurer clenched his fist in anger, wishing he could reach for his pistol and do just as the old man had done, but he knew that there was no way he would be able to get out alive if he did something as stupid as that. Then again, he was about to meet Cassius face to face, for the first time in years, how would he survive something like that? The man could only vaguely remember his first time meeting the doctor, thinking only of the menacing plague doctor helmet that he had so ingeniously made into a respirator.');
		message.channel.send('How many years ago had that been? Three? It had been fourteen years since he had fled the Constanti Academy, but he didn’t count that as meeting him. Both the adventurer himself and the crazed doctor had changed too much for events that long ago to matter anymore. Had it been three years? Only three? It had felt like an eternity, but to him time had become beyond comprehension. It was hard to keep track of time during the war, and events sped past him, running away into the deep pits of his mind, hiding behind old, fragmented memories, torn apart by time. Whenever the adventurer tried to think too hard, to remember what Cassius looked like or sounded like, the memory completely vanished, the only thing left behind being his sinister laugh, made metallic by the thick gas he wore. ');
		message.channel.send('He rolled up the sleeve of his coat briefly on his right arm and looked at his wrist. The numbers still remained: 7935, and though the burned mark had been heavily decayed with time, it was still easily readable. The numbers didn’t mean that he was the 7935th to go through with the procedure, only that he was the 7935th one to go into the doctor’s “care”. Care meant almost anything to Cassius, from replacing a limb with a robotic one, to disassembling someone simply to study them; to see how they worked.');
		message.channel.send('How did he even manage to escape that hellish place? The adventurer shook his head quickly, as to force the ideas out of his mind. The pains he withheld during those five hours were the worst of his life, and the tears that were ripped open healed only to scars, of which could never be truly fixed. Five hours of hell left a mark on his mind that endless years of peace would never be able restore. It wasn’t like that mattered, though: peace would never come for him, and he knew that and had accepted it long ago.');
		message.channel.send('The adventurer and his escort arrived at the end of the hall, at a large, rusted metal door, with no windows or possible ways of seeing out. Two white robed guards with black masks stood at each side of the door, each holding a similarly painted shotgun, aimed towards the ground, held in both hands. They looked much more formal and professional than the scrapped-armor covered soldiers that roamed the streets. The guards raised their guns silently towards the adventurer and his escort.');
		message.channel.send('“At ease!” his escort put his hand up, signaling the guards to lower their weapons, though they did not, “He’s here to see Cassius, he has orders, from the Executor.” He gestured for the adventurer to give them the sheet of paper he held, and he did so. The left hand guard walked up and snatched it out of his hand, staring at it with eyes that couldn’t be seen behind the immense, black mask. The guard nodded, putting the paper in his pocket, and opened the door, letting the adventurer through without a word.');
		message.channel.send('The room that stood before him was black and empty, even darker than the night that awaited him outside the station. Soon, the bright light from behind him began to dissipate: someone had closed the door. The door gave a loud thud as it finally shut, trapping the adventurer inside with the doctor. The adventurer removed his hood and took out his revolver.');
		message.channel.send('“Cassius, old friend, it has been a while hasn’t it?” he said, looking around the room, hoping to see something out of the darkness. A deep, heavy, metallic breathing began to come from what appeared to be the back of the room. A small light appeared behind the place where the breathing was coming from, illuminating a tall, menacing figure. A deep and heavy laugh followed, a laugh that had haunted the dreams- well, nightmares- of the adventurer for years.');
		message.channel.send('“Adrian Bauer? Your courage inspires me, yet your idiocracy makes me cringe,” the doctor said, at last revealing his metallic voice to the adventurer, “You could have been quite a fine soldier, you know? All I needed to do was make a handful of… adjustments.”');
		message.channel.send('“Torture and partial brain removal? You’re a sociopath,” Adrian spoke calmly, yet his shaking arms and sweating palms said otherwise. Cassius simply sighed, letting loose an almost robotic exhale.');
		message.channel.send('“The shadow of what could have been haunts over me still, you know. I’ve tried to forget the name, truthfully. Adrian Bauer. He died as he left the Constanti Academy. All you could have been, gone and dead. Quite a shame.”');
		message.channel.send('“I don’t regret any of it.”');
		message.channel.send('“Really? Not even after what happened to Anna?”');
		message.channel.send('“If I hadn’t left, you would have made me murder her with my own hands,” Adrian clenched his fist tighter, the bringing up of his mother, especially her death, brought upon him nothing but hatred for the man he spoke with.');
		message.channel.send('“Perhaps, but a good, loyal soldier would be willing to do such a thing. And I assure you, I could have made you loyal. Perhaps I still can?” the Doctor said, laughing again as he tapped a button he held in his hand, and a set of bright lights turned on, one in each corner of the hellish laboratory. However, the adventurer wished the lights could remain off: the sights would be enough to haunt him for the rest of his days.');
		message.channel.send('The walls were plain white, in somewhat good condition,aside from the immense stains of blood. Scratch marks from desperate “patients” drained of all hope, with nothing more than the wish to escape, but well knowing that that wish would never come true. The more the adventurer looked around the room, the more he realized that the blood had almost left no surface untouched. In the middle of the room stood an operating table, with a man, presumably dead, lying with his back up on it. The patient wore pants and shoes, but he did not have his shirt on, instead his back was laid open, with a massive scar climbing across it, cutting in so deep that it revealed his spine. There were numerous wires and cables connected to the spine, as well as metal braces that connected the spine to these wires. The man’s head was shaved bald, with the left half of his head cut open, revealing his brain, with another large brace connecting the patient’s mind to another set of wires. All the wires, both from the spine and the brain, connected to a small battery, no larger than a man’s hand and no heavier than maybe a dozen pounds, which was attached to the patient’s leg. A small piece of a cloth tarp covered the right arm of the poor man, and numerous wires from the battery, spine, and brain went under the tarp to his hand.');
		message.channel.send('The adventurer couldn’t take his eyes off the patient, not because of awe, but because of dread and a deep feeling of utter hopelessness. Despite this, he tightened his grip on his revolver and prepared to shoot. The Doctor stood behind the table where he worked on his cyborg menace, and he was just as the adventurer remembered him: a tall figure, wearing a pitch black set of bulletproof armor and blood stained, white doctor gloves, and his face was completely hidden by a spotlessly white plague doctor’s mask, with a number of tubes coming out of it, onto a small respirator near his chest, which was, like the rest of the doctor, coated in armor. His armor and clothes were stained dark red with the blood of his patients.');
		message.channel.send('“Beautiful isn’t it?” the madman let loose his metallic laugh once more, then looked at the, “I do apologize for the… mess. Had I known you were coming, Mr. Bauer, I would have prepared myself accordingly.” The Doctor glanced briefly at the adventurer’s pistol, then back up at the grim, horrified look on his face. The adventurer was scowling angrily, looking like he was about to tear someone in half, his fists were clenched, one around his revolver, the other around nothing but misty air, yet still he did not shoot the doctor.');
		message.channel.send('“Do not worry, Mr. Brauer, he came willingly. We promised him immortality, a life without fear and pain, in return for only a lifetime of service to the Republic! It sounds like a wonderful offer,” the doctor’s voice was bright and happy, yet still menacing, but it suddenly deepened as he told the man, “We didn’t lie to him, really. We just… didn’t tell him some of the lesser things that might occur after the surgery.”');
		message.channel.send('Adrian watched the doctor closely as he walked towards a wall with a very large scratch mark and ran his hand along it, “Once he heard about the true process of the surgery- transformation I should call it, really. A normal surgery works to fix something, change something. My surgery, my… transformation… works to make one perfect. But I’m getting off track,” Cassius laughed lightly as he continues his story, “Once he had heard about the real process of the transformation, he did his very best in an attempt to escape. We slaughtered his attempt, but,” the Doctor traced his hand across the large scar on the wall once more, “his attempt did come at a cost to us, and to him. His personality was broken, he could never be truly fixed. He could never be the same as he was before the transformation, and I made sure of that. Besides the normal removal of the amygdala, I also removed and damaged a large section, of the frontal lobe- specifically to destroy his personality. He acts like an ape, almost, yet more sophisticated, almost like a mercenary. But you know what I didn’t remove? Hatred. And all I need to do in order to turn enable this hatred,” the Doctor reached into his pocket and pulled out a small device, and flicked a button on it, “is press a button.”');
		message.channel.send('The adventurer backed away from the Doctor and his patient. The patient began to rise slowly, first putting his hand, the one not covered by cloth, onto the bed and pushing himself up. He took his right leg and raised it to stand, then got up into the other, leaving himself to crouch with one hand on the table. He stood up fully, with his back to the adventurer, but slowly turned to face him and jump off the table, standing right in front of him and stared him in the eyes. The eyes of the patient were unblinking, nor did they ever disconnect themselves from the eyes of the adventurer.');
		message.channel.send('“What is this? What have you-”');
		message.channel.send('“A patient, Mr. Bauer. One of my proudest creations, only below Cassia.”');
		message.channel.send('**‘This isn’t a creation, it’s a monstrosity!”**');
		message.channel.send('“A monstrosity, please! Mr. Bauer, I taught you to be a gentlemen, now show the respect you’ve learned!” the Doctor said, laughing as he looked over to Adrian, who simply glared silently, the same look of hatred on his face.');
		message.channel.send('“Now, I am dearly sorry, Mr. Bauer, but I am afraid I won’t be able to let you leave this place. If the Rebellion got word of this, why, the Executor would give me hell!” he laughed again, likely giving some menacing grin from before. Adrian raised his arm to shoot his pistol, but before he could shoot, the patient grabbed him by the neck with his completely robotic left hand, choking and holding him above the ground, his fist like a clamp. In a last attempt for life, he shot his pistol, rapidly and randomly. Six loud bangs, all of which echoed throughout the halls, each of them missing the creation and it’s maker. The adventurer gagged for a breath, hoping to keep consciousness, but to no avail. He felt his head getting heavy, and felt himself collapse as the robotic hand finally let him go. Yet even after he was able to breath, his vision still faded to black.');
		message.channel.send('“Put him with the others,” he could hear the Plague Doctor say as he finally failed himself, and let himself into the darkness of unconsciousness.');
		message.channel.send('Adrian’s eyes opened slowly, blinking rapidly as they did, trying to clear his blurred vision from the blood, sweat, and tears. He was lying in a small, rusted room with a bulky looking metal door. The only light in the room came from it’s small cracks and hinges, giving him just enough light to see the few things closest to the door. He was still in his hooded clothes, however they were ragged and torn, with a large scar protruding through his jeans, showing a massive cut. But how did it get there? It must have happened while he was unconscious. The man shook his head, trying to let his thoughts out of his clotted brain. What was going on? The first thing that came to his mind as soon as he had woken up was pain: a massive scar running along his left calf, his neck still tight, only allowing for an occasional, painful breath.');
		message.channel.send('He slowly tried to stand up, though he was hardly able; with his right leg holding the majority of his weight, leaving everything else to be carried by his left, causing it immense, unbearable pain. He felt for his holster, hoping that his one chance of escape would still be there, but all he felt was the empty, dense air. No gun, no knife, no hope; that was the world he lived in. His legs collapsed under him, dropping him onto the hard, dusty concrete floor. The pain in his leg flared up again, and the man winced in pain. He sat up and looked at the scar, trying to make out the damage with the little rays of light. The scar was deeper than he had seen before, and it was bleeding immensely. He quickly ripped off the little piece left of his cape and wrapped it around the scar in an effort to stop the blood gushing out of it. Why was there so little left of the cape? It had been glorious, flowing down unto the ground. Where had it all gone? The thought crossed the adventurer’s mind, but he disregarded it, considering it to be unimportant, and he laid back down in an attempt to ease the pain, to let his wound heal as he waited.');
		message.channel.send('Adrian closed his eyes and became encased in his thought again. “How did I get here, what had I done wrong?” Adrian closed his eyes and became encased in his thought again, mumbling them aloud to keep himself awake, “Should have shot the bastard as soon as I…”');
		message.channel.send('He ceased his mumbling, deciding that it was better for anyone that might have been watching or listening not to hear. The adventurer’s thoughts immediately drifted off to ideas of escape: how, where, when? They soared through the man’s mind, but none of them seemed to stick, be it because of his brain’s constant blackouts that still occasionally occurred, or because any legitimate plans that did come to his mind were quickly deemed impossible. The man lay, crumpled up, in almost complete hopelessness, simply awaiting whatever fate was to now come his way, praying for little more than death. Fate, on the other hand, had no intent of giving him a quick death.');
		message.channel.send('A loud knocking came from the door, but Adrian refused to stand or even pay attention to the knocking, instead letting himself be embraced by darkness and hopelessness. The knock came a few more times, and after discovering that his knocks were not disturbing the adventurer, whoever was outside knocking spoke. ');
		message.channel.send('“Head Doctor Cassius wants to speak with you. You can comply, or be hung as a sentence from the Council of the Republic,” the soldier spoke through a tiny gap in the door. The adventurer sat up, bringing more pain to his scar, and said to the soldier with the little strength he had left, “Let him speak with me.” The wishes of death had left his mind; the only way to escape his captors would to negotiate with them, which, at worst, would at least prolong his life for another few hours.');
		message.channel.send('The door slowly creaked open, and the light blared through and blinded the adventurer, who immediately put his hand in front of his eyes in order to shield them. The door hit the wall with a thud, and the loud, echoing sound of the Doctor’s metallic boots came closer. The doctor walked inside and leaned himself against the wall, “My my, Adrian, you seem injured,” he said as he stared down at the man, taking notice to the hidden scar on his leg.');
		message.channel.send('“I guess A049 decided it wouldn’t be enough to simply leave you here… apologies.” The Doctor’s eyes were hidden behind his mask, shiny pieces of glass letting him see out but not the adventurer in, instead the adventurer saw only himself in the reflection, only his eyes, filled with a hellish, burning hatred that overshadowed over even the deep, eternal fear.');
		message.channel.send('“Why are you meeting with me? Why not just kill me?” the man grunted in the strongest voice he could muster, risking his fate, again wandering over to a wish for nothing more than death. ');
		message.channel.send('“Kill you?”, the Doctor laughed heartily at the man, letting loose a metallic roar that echoed in the cell, “No, no, that is… too good a fate for you. Death… too simple.”');
		message.channel.send('“Then what are you going to do with me, you bastard!?” the man spat at the Doctor in anger and fear, as he let free his metallic laugh once more. The Doctor kneeled on one knee in front of the man, staring right into his eyes, almost letting the beak of his mask touch his nose, saying, “That’s classified. You’ll see eventually, but for now? I am the one asking the questions,” he backed up from the adventurer and began pacing around the room. “');
		message.channel.send('Now,” the Doctor said calmly as he took out a large needle from his pocket, “how did you get the note from the Executor? I managed to contact him a few hours ago, and I was told that he had no knowledge of that paper.”');
		message.channel.send('“That’s none of your business you-”');
		message.channel.send('“Ah ah ah, language. Now I am afraid that if you refuse to comply,” the Doctor places the syringe near the adventurer’s arm, “we will be forced to… destroy you, just like we did A049. Make you forget everything but hatred and despair. You don’t want that, now do you?”');
		message.channel.send('“For you to make more monsters?”');
		message.channel.send('“Monsters?” Cassius asked, taken back by the question, “They are not monsters, they are creations of science! Works of genius! Mr. Bauer, realize that I am not an inhumane man. Anything I do works towards the good of science, towards the good of my people! I am a family man, you know. I have a wonderful wife and the sweetest little girl. What do you have? A sad little home in Seditionem Ventum”');
		message.channel.send('“Who would marry you? A psychopath?” he chose not to answer the question because he knew he was right.');
		message.channel.send('“She was a good woman, really. It’s a shame she passed. But life goes on, does it not? And I assure you, Mr. Bauer, my work goes to make sure it does.”');
		message.channel.send('“You call this life? What you create isn’t-”');
		message.channel.send('He was cut short as there was a loud banging coming from outside the door: another soldier, knocking to get the Doctor. “Sorry to bother you sir, but there’s a uh… situation,” the soldier said. There was a short moment of silence, where the man, whose senses were at last coming to and his hearing becoming as sharp as it usually was, could here distant screams and the roars of gunfire, as well as loud, metallic footsteps, coming constantly closer, like an old army in steel boots. “What do you mean a situation!?” the Doctor stopped pacing and went to the soldier at the door, “The rebels, or whatever the hell they call themselves, taking the station by storm. We have them blocked them off at the second airlock, but it won’t last long. We’re outnumbered, sir,” the soldier spoke excitedly, and there was a definite look of fear in his eyes.');
		message.channel.send('The Doctor quickly put away his syringe and took out a pistol from his holster, “I am sorry, Mr. Bauer, but it looks like our time together has come to a close,” he pointed the gun at the adventurer’s chest, and as the distant sound of gunfire continued to grow near, he fired the gun, catching him in the side of his chest; a painful strike, but not a lethal one if it was treated correctly. Pain shot around the man’s body, making him feel as though he was being torn into shreds from the inside out. His vision blurred, and the echoing, deep sound of the revolver’s shot filled his ears. His eyes began to tear up, but through what he could still see he saw the soldier and the Doctor exiting the cell, and could hear them talking, though he was not able to decipher what it was they were saying. The gunshots came closer and closer, clearly following the Doctor, but soon came to a close, and all that remained were the metallic footsteps.');
		message.channel.send('A few of the rebel fighters walked past the cell, and the adventurer tried to call out to them, but his cries were too quiet and weak. He began to slowly close his eyes, accepting his fate, his death. Then the footsteps came astonishingly close to him, and he could see an outline of a tall man in military armor standing in front of him, trying to get his attention. Leave me alone, let me die, the man thought, but to no avail. He could see the figure gesture towards his friends, and heard a loud yell, saying, “He’s still alive, here! Someone get a doctor!” The adventure lightheartedly chuckled inside at the call for a doctor, for it was a doctor that had done this to him. He saw a few more soldiers enter the room, one, two, three, his vision was too blurred to tell anymore, and he closed his eyes in hope that he would be able to sleep as they carried him away. He felt soft, leather gloves on his shoulders and legs, which slowly picked him up and put him unto a stretcher. “Just a little gunshot wound, nothing a trip to ol’ Ainsworth won’t fix,” one of the rebels said, “But your leg… that… oh. I think that-”');
		message.channel.send('The soldier speaking stopped and shouted something, but he couldn’t understand it with his dulled senses. He was probably calling for a doctor. Adrian remembered Ainsworth, an old colleague of his, one of the head figures in the movement against the Republic. Anton Ainsworth, the thought wandered around in his head, but immediately left as he began to consider other things: What was he going to do with himself after he recovered? Return to life back in Seditionem Ventum? He couldn’t just leave the rebellion, he was one of the most important figures in it, but he didn’t wish to continue this lifestyle. He wanted nothing more than to be out of Michigan, somewhere peaceful, quiet, where he could grow old and die a simple man: a farmer, a repairman, something like that, but life wasn’t that simple.');
		message.channel.send('The sound of shoes pounding against the concrete, sprinting towards the man, became noticeably louder. He opened his eyes for a second, and saw a soldier salute a man dressed in all white, who carried a large bag in his hand. Before he could tell what it was, his vision blurred out again, and he was left with nothing but his hearing to guide him. The man in white spoke, an unrecognizable voice to the adventurer, but it spoke calmingly, saying, “Mr. Bauer, what a mess you’ve gotten yourself into. Still, nothing a few band-aids won’t heal eventually, eh?” The adventurer coughed, his throat burned from thirst, and he winced in pain yet again. The doctor reached into his pocket and pulled out a syringe filled with blue liquid, and he flinched at the sight of it, “No worries,” he said as he saw the adventurer’s movement, “just a simple procedure.” The doctor stabbed the syringe into his arm, and the adventurer’s senses began to dull, as his eyes slowly closed, and did not blink back open.');
		message.channel.send('“Alright, I think he’s waking up,” another unknown voice said. The adventurer shook his head with the little strength he had and lazily started to open his eyes. There were two figures dressed in white lab coats in front of him, but he couldn’t make out their faces with his still-blurred vision.');
		message.channel.send('“Mr. Bauer? Mr. Bauer!?” one of the doctors asked intently as he stared down at the adventurer, who began to slowly sit up from his comfortable, cloth bed. He looked around him: he was in a plain white room, which had clearly seen some damages in the past but it appeared that whoever was currently in control of this place- currently in control of him- had fixed it up quite well. Why was it so familiar? He sat up completely, his legs still outstretched upon the bed, though they were hidden under a small, white blanket, with a red lining of linen. “Where am I?” he said calmly, with an almost threatening tone, as though he would grab the necks of the doctors if they didn’t respond quickly enough. “Easy now, we’ll explain everything to you soon,” the doctor on the left said, as the one on his right walked over to a small table on the side of the room. The adventurer kicked off the blanket and stared at his leg where the scar had been. Where his calf used to be, there was a short, thick, dark silver, metal rod, with wires and circuits hanging out of it, and a long wire connecting to a metal brace that clinged to the back of his thigh.');
		message.channel.send('“What have you done to me?” the adventurer asked the doctors, very tense in his movements, now speaking openingly threateningly. “There was nothing else we could do. The cut was too deep- it had been permanently paralyzed. We wanted to leave it be, let you limp with a cast and be free of duty, but General Reynolds demanded we do, said you were “too good of an asset to lose,” the doctor said calmly, now pacing the room around the adventurer’s medical bed, “I’d take that as a compliment. God knows she’d be willing to let any of us die or get crippled and could throw it off to the side as though we were just a damned Republic soldier.” The adventurer shook his head in hatred and an acceptance of defeat, saying only, “Jane never changes, does she?”');
		message.channel.send('The two doctors chuckled slightly, and nodded their heads in agreement, as though they feared that the General would come after them herself if they said something against her. The adventurer turned his body and let his legs slide off the bed and touch the ground, sitting up. He was wearing an old, white shirt, which was mostly clean besides the occasional blood stain, and a pair of shorts which cut off just where his knee was; just where the robotic leg began. He took his hand and ran it along his new limb: the metal was cold and smooth, with nothing but one or two red wires coming out of it, connecting to a metal brace on his upper leg, and he suddenly winced at the sight of it. It was so familiar, and the memory poked at him angrily: the poor man on the operating table, turned into a machine by that clinically insane doctor, not even a fate that one of those Republic soldiers deserved. Whatever the thing was on his leg, it was not technology of the Resistance.');
		message.channel.send('“This… thing… on my leg, it’s not Cassius’ machinery, right?” the adventurer asked with a worried look on his face;  he wanted nothing that menace made to touch him, in fact he wanted nothing more than to see him lying dead. “I’m afraid it is, Mr. Bauer. It was the only technology at hand, and it was in quite good condition when we found it,” one of the doctors told him as he walked back over towards the bed and extended a hand as though to help the adventurer up. Instead of accepting his offer, he smacked the hand away with the most force he had used in days, “I’d rather be dead than have something that monster made attached to my leg!” he shouted in anger, receiving only mumbled responses from both his doctors, both saying something along the lines of, “Orders are orders”.');
		message.channel.send('The adventurer stood up out of the bed, walking on his new, robotic leg almost perfectly, though still tripping or almost falling once or twice. He looked around for a moment, then reached towards a cabinet, searching for something. “Where is it?” he said as he ripped open a cabinet. only finding some medical and robotic supplies, “Where the hell did you take it you bastards!?” He yelled at no one and nothing, screaming out in anger, searching for the one piece he had left of his mother, a short blade he had dubbed “Vengeance”, with a sharp tip and a few words engraved into the handle, “I love you and I will protect you.” The last words he heard from his mother before- he quickly shoot the memory out of his mind, and a single, small tear escaped his eye and slid down his face, dropping unto the floor. He held his hand to his face and wiped away anything left of his sadness and sprinted towards the door. It had been left wide open, but the adventurer had not gazed at it until now.');
		message.channel.send('He held his hand against the side of the door and gazed outside at the station, suddenly realizing why the room was so recognizable to him: it was the Plague Doctor’s “hospital”, the one where he created A049. There was a hand on his shoulder, coming from behind him: the doctor from before. In the other hand was a small suitcase, seemingly quite light. The hand left his shoulder as the adventurer turned to face the man, who in turn backed up a step in fear. “You have orders to return to Seditionem Ventum. Issued by General Reynolds herself,” he said cautiously, as though he were scared that he would anger the adventurer, and held out the suitcase for him to take. The adventurer took the case carefully and inspected it’s exterior thoroughly, then slowly beginning to open it. The contents of the case were somewhat limited: a black leather jacket with faded brown outlines, a small revolver filled with bullets, a pair of jeans, a gas mask, another smaller box, and two metal toed boots.');
		message.channel.send('He placed the case on the ground and took out the jacket and threw it over his shoulders, then took out the jeans and slid them on over his shorts. He slid into the shoes, put his new revolver into one of his pockets, and stared into the shiny glass eyes of the gas mask. In it he saw himself for the first time in what felt to him like years, but not the same man that he saw in the mirror the day he walked into Antonia Street Station: a deep scar ran across his face, running from his left eyebrow to the edge of his lip; he saw a man with no emotion in his eyes, no driving fire or hope, only hatred and fear: he was no longer an adventurer, but a survivor. He turned the mask around and strapped it to his face, then drew his attention to the final item in the case: a small, wooden box. He took it and showed it to the doctor, who still stood at the door, waiting, “What is this thing?” the adventurer asked him.');
		message.channel.send('The doctor simply waited and said, “Open it.” He did as he was told, and he at last found what he had been searching for, and a small hint of hope returned to his eyes. “Thank you,” the adventurer sputtered at the doctor as he tried to hide his tears. He put the blade into his opposite pocket and began to walk towards the surface.');
		message.channel.send('“Sorry sir, station’s on lockdown,” the man in scavenged military armor lazily told the adventurer as he walked towards the airlock at the edge of the station. The guard wore a gas mask, similar to that worn by the adventurer himself, and stood up straight and tall, though was clearly tired, perhaps even injured, and did not wish to be there. “Says who?” the adventurer snapped back angrily. “Captain Clark, direct orders to keep the airlock to the surface sealed for a week until we are confirmed clear. Anyone attempting to open or escape the airlock will be terminated, so I advise you step back,” the guard lazily took out his rifle from behind his back, merely as protocol; he knew who the adventurer was, but he knew that if he didn’t he would be punished by his superiors, “Sorry sir, but I’m afraid the only way back to Seditionem Ventum is through the southern tunnel.”');
		message.channel.send('The adventurer simply nodded in response and turned away in defeat, knowing that despite his high rank among the Rebellion, Captain Clark was still above him and that he couldn’t just disobey a direct command. But even as such, he still needed to get back to Seditionem Ventum, though it wasn’t the orders that were given to him that drove him there. The adventurer stood on the edge of the station and hopped down unto the southern tracks, feeling a sudden dampness in the soles of his boots. There tunnel was pitch black ahead of him, and it clearly lead downwards, and there was water that came up, hardly even up to the tip of his shoe. On the side of the tunnel opposite the station, there were two men, both old and ragged, worn by time and age, each carrying a small sack of belongings and a long rod. Behind them was what appeared to be a rusted motorboat, with an engine that must have fallen apart and been repaired numerous times by the looks of it, and a hull that doubtlessly had sprung countless leaks. The adventurer walked over to them, slowly and casually, removing his gas mask as to be more polite and formal: despite his hellish times in the Doctor’s chambers, his etiquette had still not been lost.');
		message.channel.send('“Excuse me, but where are you two heading?” the adventurer asked with a higher pitched, politer voice, one he had not used since he last spoke to his mother, years ago. Being closer to them, he could see that they were both covered in ash and dirt, as well as dark gloves that were stained in inhuman blue blood, and with clearer vision in his eyes, the poles turned from useless sticks into fishing rods. One of the men turned around, holding a lantern, and looked intently at the adventurer, speaking in a deep, old voice, clearly scarred and torn by cigarettes and alcohol, “Whatchu want?” He spoke in a very stern voice, as though he wished for the adventurer to be gone and out of his sight as soon as possible so that he and his colleague could continue with whatever work they were doing before his arrival. “I need a ride, down the Antonia-Academy Line,” the adventurer said in his polite tone, clearly trying to keep the goal of his journey discreet, as he did not know if these old men were sympathizers with the Republic that were merely journeying through Antonia Street Station as a midway station, or as a stop to get repairs to send their boat on another trip into the dark abyss of the eternally and hellishly dark and empty subway system.');
		message.channel.send('“Well what do we get out of it? We’ll take you as far as Chilltop Station, that’s our last stop,” the other old man replied, in a seemingly younger, though just as agitated voice, “We’re just about to set off. Get in or rot in this station.” The men were clearly not happy about the Rebellion controlling the station, and Chilltop was a Republic controlled station, they were most likely Republic sympathizers, but the station was to be locked down for another week, and there was no other way to the surface. The adventurer hopped into the boat quickly, anxious to be on his way, yet fearful about what fate lay for him inside the tunnel. The two men began to push the boat deeper into the water as the tunnel began to slope downwards, and once it was deep enough in to move by the motor, they both hopped in at sat next to each other, facing the adventurer in silence. The one with the lantern sat it down next to him, in between him and his friend, and pulled a switch that started the motor. The engine spat some dark liquid and smoke for a moment, then sputtered and came to life, pushing the adventurer and his new comrades deeper into the darkness.');
		message.channel.send('After a few minutes of hearing nothing but the spitting of the motor and seeing the darkness of the tunnel, only lit by the dim lantern of the fisherman, the adventurer finally spoke, “So where are you two headed off to?” The two men glanced at each other briefly, then the seemingly older one whispered something into the ear of the younger one in a very suspicious manner that the adventurer merely overlooked. “We’re fishermen, if you couldn’t tell,” the younger one said politely yet harshly, as though not to anger the adventurer but to end the conversation, as he gestured towards their fishing rods, “We were making a sales trip down the Antonia-Academy Line, and were heading back to our homes at Chilltop as you came over to us.” So that proves it then, these men were from the Republic, though if they were sympathizers or simply were forced to live under them because of the Republic’s imperialist nature was uncertain. The adventurer shuffled in his seat, moving one hand towards the pocket where his revolver was hidden, just in case what he feared worst was to happen.');
		message.channel.send('Another few minutes of silence followed the short conversation as the slope finally ended, bringing them so close to the ceiling that if one were to stand up in the boat he would hit his head on the concrete roof. The adventurer decided to test the waters again with the two fisherman, saying, “So you live under the iron fist of the Republic? And how do you find that?” The two men began to speak at the same time, but the older one cut the other one off quickly with his louder, dominant voice, saying, “We find it rather… how do I say it… joyous? Enjoyable? Something like that, you understand what I mean. Hence why we were so quick to turn back once we saw what Antonia Station had become.” The adventurer kept this in the back of his mind, trying to drag information out of the two men, “Really?” he said in the same, calm tone as he had used earlier, “I’m not a Rebel, mind you, but I don’t exactly take a liking to Cassius’ inhumane experiments.” The two men showed clear aggravation on their faces, yet tried to hide it best they could in order to be somewhat polite.');
		message.channel.send('“So what have you two heard about the escape of Adrian Bauer?” the adventurer said after he realized that the old men had no intentions of responding to his insults against the Republic. “Yes. Bastard deserves to be shot. If only the Republic would let us join their military, we would be out hunting for him instead of catching these damn fish. Or at least I would be,” the younger one responded with eyes full of anger and hatred, clearly not only angry at the adventurer, but also at the older man.');
		message.channel.send('The adventurer shuffled himself in his seat again, somewhat worried, but the older man grinned and opened a box that was laid out in between the seats. “I do apologize for my brother’s tenseness,” the man said as he opened the box and took out three bottles of beer and handed one to his brother, “He always gets like this around strangers. Here, please, take this.” The adventurer kept one hand on the holster while moving the other to take the beer, and flicking off the cap with one thrust of his thumb. He took one sip out of the beer, it was strong in alcohol, with a sweet taste, yet such a strong one that the adventurer closed his eyes and shook his head as he swallowed it. “Good stuff, where’s it from?” he said in response, driving the conversation away from the disputed topic of the Republic. The younger one simply shrugged and the older man spoke lazily after take a sip of his own drink, saying, “We don’t know where it came from, we just bought a couple boxes of the stuff off a traveling merchant back at Antonia Station a few days ago. Shame the poor bastard got shot in the head a little while after.”');
		message.channel.send('“Serves him right,” the younger one said with the same look in his eyes, “Bastard needed to pay his debt, it’s his problem if he can’t do that. I never liked him, too much of a rebellious look about him.” Their conversation was cut short suddenly by a loud noise coming from the water beneath them, at which the adventurer nearly jumped out of his seat. “No worries,” the older man, noticing the adventurer’s fear, calming him slightly, “It won’t attack us, we’re in the boat. But the second anyone leaves this thing,” the old man stopped speaking and merely did the old fashioned finger-gun-to-head movement, “Dead.” The adventurer nodded slightly and returned to his calmed position and took another large sip of the bottle of beer, which, much to his surprise, he had already almost finished. His vision had started to blur a bit from all the alcohol, but it was nothing that would do any damage; at worst he might have to glance overboard for a moment and barf. After another minute of silence, the adventurer realized that the conversation was not going to resume, and out of boredom, he pulled his knife out from his pocket and began staring at the words engraved into the handle: I love you and I will protect you.');
		message.channel.send('He omitted a quiet sigh of sigh of relief, letting his mind be filled with the few memories he still had of his mother, not all of which were the most joyous, yet the mere thought of her put joy in his mind. He glanced up briefly to see what his hosts were doing: both of them were now facing each other, occasionally glancing at an blood and dirt stained piece of paper; the older of them held a knife in their opposite hand, the other a small revolver made of scrap metal. The younger one must have noticed the adventurer’s glance, as he made a gesture towards the old man and pointed at him, pointing his gun towards the adventurer. The adventurer, not knowing how else to react, continued looking down at his knife that sat in his lap innocently, while he reached into his opposite pocket, the one that held his own revolver. “You know it really is quite strange, how similar you look to this Adrian Ba-” the younger kid’s sentence was quickly cut short as a bullet was sent straight through his face, going straight through his nose and rebounding against the tunnel halls, unleashing a hellish echo.');
		message.channel.send('The dead one’s body hit the boat with a loud thud that rocked the ship, letting a small bit of water in, but not enough to capsize it. Before the older one could even get up, the adventurer leaped out of his seat, shot him straight through the middle of his chest, right where his lung would be, and kicked him overboard before his crashing fall could capsize the boat. The adventurer took up the lantern and looked over towards the side of the boat where he had kicked the man, just to make sure he wasn’t going to come back aboard. There was a large red stain in the water by where the corpse of the man had landed, but before long, a massive eel shaped thing with a massive jaw came and pulled the corpse down into the hellish oblivion below. The adventurer omitted a sigh of relief, and sat back down in his seat, wiping the blood stains off his new jacket and holstering his gun back in his pocket.');
		message.channel.send('The adventurer sat forward in his seat, looking through the box of his hosts’ goods. The box was wooden and old, filled to the brim with an assortment of scrap and paper and beer bottles, next to which lied the stained picture, facing down, which the two fishermen held before they lashed out at him. He picked it up with two fingers and twisted it over in his hand, revealing a small, blurry picture of himself, with large text above reading: Adrian Bauer, Wanted Dead for Treason Against the Republic. He looked at the picture for a moment, noticing the large scar that still ripped his face in half: the picture must have been taken while he was in captivity, after the Doctor’s monstrosity gave him his scars. He stared at the picture for a moment more, then crumpled it up and threw it over the side of the boat in a violent rush of anger, and continued searching through the box. More beer, an empty rifle clip, many other items of the sort clotted up the box, concealing an old, leather laced book.');

The adventurer, finding quite an enjoyment for writing himself, quickly put the book and pen inside a small flap inside his jacket. He took himself away from the box, and looked up: the ceiling had begun to slope back up again; he had almost arrived at Chilltop. He strapped on his gas mask, and waited as the deep sounds of the engine brought him through the darkness, to his next destination.');
		message.channel.send('The boat hit the concrete floor of the tunnel with a loud thud. This was as far as it would take the adventurer. He stood up quickly and hopped out of the boat, in a very casual yet slick movement, taking the lantern from the boat with him, as the walk to Chilltop was still at least another mile. His boots hit the water with a loud splash that echoed through the halls, and the water went up to his ankles, filling his boots and wetting his socks disgustingly. He held the lantern in his left hand, and with his right he drew his pistol: a path between warring stations was not a safe one. The adventurer began to walk slowly, letting his echoing, splashing footsteps fill the infinitely dark and hellish tunnel. With each step, the water began to lessen and lessen, and it continued to do so for a long time, perhaps even an hour.');
		message.channel.send('Much to the adventurer’s surprise, there were few Republic guards at the entry to the station, only one man standing at a machine gun post behind a few sandbags, who merely nodded at the adventurer and let him pass. Chilltop was the poster boy of the Republic, so to speak. Open vendors and salesmen and cults, you could buy whatever you desired. On the surface, it looked like a perfect haven, but if one dug down deep enough they could truly see the Republic pulling all the strings, asking those who did not pay their overpriced taxes to come in for “questioning”, well they were only being taken to the side to be shot discretely so that another, more loyal man could take his or her place, a station captain that would shoot anyone in the head that questioned his authority. But the adventurer had no thoughts of digging deep enough to uncover that, only to walk in and walk out. He climbed an old wooden set of stairs that creaked with every movement he made, and stepped onto the station. It shone brightly with candles and electric lights, shops and stores all set up and open, lining the halls of the decayed station. Some offered junk, some offered food, truly anything a man desired could be bought at Chilltop. Anything but freedom.');
		message.channel.send('As he walked along the station, the salesmen began to beckon out at him, shouting numerous calls, “Fish! Get your fish!” , “Ammo! Guns! Knives!” , “Scrap metal, fresh from the yards up north!” They all competed to yell over each other, creating a loud sound that dulled any other noise, each calling out to everyone who passed, focusing on one man, then focusing on another after they realized that he was only walking past. Republic guards paced back and forth, minding their own business and paying no attention to the businessmen that filled their station. The station was so full of movement, so crowded, the adventurer nearly had to push his way to get towards the exit, and the crowd only became denser as he drew closer to it. As he came closer to the exit, the crowd began to thin, the people becoming less so the rich, happy men that they once were, but instead a sad, poor bunch, selling what little they had managed to scavenge outside. The Republic guards were more clear here, taking any that seemed to stink up the station or made their own home in a little corner of the station, dragging them off by the arms, covering their mouths to hide their shouts of despair. The adventurer passed most of these occurrences; as much as he hated to see these innocents taken away like this, there was nothing he could do about it. Taking action was a death wish.');
		message.channel.send('There was one of them that caught his eye. A little girl, no older than thirteen, sitting against a wall, in an old blue dress, seemingly untorn yet covered in ash and dust and small spots of blood. She sat with her head in her hands, crying, letting only a few tears flow past her face and unto the dark, concrete floor. The adventurer went up to her, thinking of it as a final chance to be a good man without spilling the blood of his enemies. “Hey, kid?” he asked as he sat down next to her, “Are you okay?” The girl glanced up at him with the corner of her eye, her face red and wet from tears, and immediately covered herself back up. “No,” she said, still sobbing. “Where are your mom and dad?” the adventurer said, hoping to console her. “Dead,” she said, clearly lying. After a moment of silence she noticed that the adventurer could see through her lies, and she lifted her head up a bit, easing her tears. “I… I ran away. I couldn’t take them anymore!” she said in a quiet voice, yet one that almost sounded as though she were shouting for help, but her little voice couldn’t manage to do so through all the tears, “But they’re going to come after me! And they’ll take me back and he’ll hit me again! No, no, no!” The girl put her face back into her hands and continued sobbing. The adventurer put his hand on her shoulder, and the girl, though clearly surprised by this act of kindness, did not wince or try to take him off, but instead embraced his sudden compassion.');

The adventurer simply nodded and stood up, offering his hand down to her in order for her to do the same, which she promptly took and held firmly with her hand. Standing up, she was only as tall as the man’s chest, needing to stare almost straight up in order to see his face. The girl held his hand, and the two continued to walk out the station.

		message.channel.send('The walk to Seditionem Ventum was only a bit longer, and the sun was already coming down upon the horizon. It gleamed in Adrian’s gasmask, and the shadows of the two were cast long behind them. The city was old and forgotten, most of the buildings in ruins or just completely flattened. The street was covered in rubble, some from the skyscrapers above, other from the streetlights and cars that used to light up the now motionless city. The sky was blue and clear, with the stars burning bright and the moon beginning to shine behind them as the sun set. There was the occasional roar from a distant creature, a ear twisting screech from someone being slaughtered far away, yet they all kept their distance; this road was safe, for whatever reason. Everyone and everything simply stayed away from it, as though it were totally pointless, and the adventurer, throughout his many trips to and from the city, had learned to take advantage of that. Another one of the beasts roared, slightly closer, but it had no effect on the adventurer and his newfound friend. They continued walking, and the city began to fade behind them, tall skyscrapers turning into short houses and apartments, which soon became scarcer and scarcer, being separated by trees and gardens. A set of footsteps could be heard, walking almost in synchronization with them, but they were not human steps, the metallic clink of the claws banging against the concrete floor so a nearby building. It howled again, still drawing closer, and this howling brought with it more of the clawed footsteps. ');

She hid herself behind him, hugging his leg, and they both stood motionlessly as the metallic steps drew closer. He aimed his gun up and shot into the air, hoping to drive the animals away. The shot echoed through the abandoned streets, and Carla winced at the sound of it, but soon after looked out from behind Adrian’s leg. The footsteps stopped for a moment, followed by one howl, then a second,then a third, then more and more, at least a dozen. The adventurer took the girl with one hand and put her over his shoulders. She was light, not enough to stop him from running, but enough to throw him off for a second. They stood in this still position for what, to them, felt like years. There was a loud thud that came from behind them, the sound of something hitting the old dirt covered road. He turned around almost immediately, and in front of him stood a large, for legged creatures. It’s head resembled that of a dog, with large teeth and stream of thick, white drool coming out of it’s mouth. The figure resembled a dog, but it was much larger than a dog should be, bigger than an average man, with longer, more muscular legs. “Cover your eyes,” the adventurer said sternly, as he pointed the gun towards the creature, but did not fire. The girl hid her eyes, shoving her face into the side of man’s head, and the creature slowly began to walk towards the two. It let out a deep, aggressive growl, and couched down as though it were about to leap. Another gunshot sounded out of the adventurer’s gun, and the dog fell to the ground with a noticeably loud thud, as a small pool blue blood appeared beneath it.');

There was another thud, like the one before, and a few more of the dogs’ loud calls followed the two of them closely. Another one of the beasts leaped towards them, but the adventurer strafed to the side quickly enough for it to miss them, but it’s claws still scratched his shoulder and tore through the jacket, leaving a three-clawed scar on his shoulder. The adventurer, without a second thought, took his pistol and shot the dog in the chest, a shot not strong enough to kill it, but powerful enough to paralyze it until something swooped in and ate it. His legs ached, they hadn’t moved this quickly in ages, but he knew that the beasts wouldn’t just stop chasing them. His legs gave out, not so much that he fell to the ground, but he could no longer run or sprint, or hardly even walk. The dogs stopped a few yards behind him, almost as though they were worried that he was laying a trap for them. He turned around, and picked up the girl from his shoulder and put her on the ground. He took out his pistol and opened the clip, only one bullet left. There were five creatures ahead of him. He took the gun and shot the closest one to him as it let loose a loud cry, and he slammed the gun back into it’s holster and took out the knife with the other. ');

Another one howled, and the adventurer gestured for the girl to start running away; if he were not to make it out alive, she should. The adventurer began to step back, with the girl a few steps behind him, as she had not run away. The dogs growled at each other, all three of them, not following the adventurer and his companion. They began backing away faster, and the dogs merely growled at them.

The richer men in town, those who served in the Rebellion, usually, were able to live in more formal, cleaner houses, with steel that had been remade and cleaned, with clean windows with cloth curtains that were usually closed. Old men sat on their chairs outside their house, some playing with an old guitar and singing an old tune, others telling their grandchildren stories and tales of what had happened long ago. Guards patrolled the streets, some picking up conversations with the locals and sometimes even the visitors, others keeping to themselves and shooing away anyone that came towards them.

He opened the door, the room was nearly empty aside from a table and three chairs in the middle, and a bed near the back. There was a lamp on a side table, with a large box next to it, and the lamp was still on. “I’m sorry, there’s only one-” the adventurer started off, immediately interrupted by her. “It’s fine,” she exclaimed, and immediately hopped into the bed, a wide grin across her face. The man sighed, one of happiness, the same type the girl showed, they merely showed this joyfulness in a different fashion. He took out the book and the pen from his earlier trip, opened to the first page, and let his thoughts flow.');
		message.channel.send('“This war has scarred me deeply, across my face and through my heart. It took my mother, my father, my home, everything I held dear to me. This girl,” the adventurer wrote as he turned to see her behind him, laying in bed, silent and asleep, that smile still drawn across her face, “so innocent. Happy. She loves me like a father simply for taking her under my wing. But I don’t want to take her in, my life is too dark, upsetting. She has such a chance for hers, down south in the markets of Rhode Island, or the newfounded republics out to the west. I want to end this war with my two hands, for the little girls like her. For the children. I question humanity for their actions, but there is nothing I can do. I let scars be torn and I tear some myself. And all for what? A little adventurer can’t change the tide of a war. I’m nothing but a pawn on a giant chessboard to these idiots, Jane, and that unknown military mastermind that controls this whole rebellion and his own God damned military. I know all this, yet I still can sleep sound at night. I have been fighting for seven years now, longer than almost everybody on the Council. Jane, Lucas, all of them. Sitting behind their chairs pacing back and forth between the halls of the Council of Rebellion, acting like they know what it’s like to be nothing more than a pawn for the player. On the surface I am an emotionless monster, doing nothing but killing and shooting and murdering, all in the name of this God-forsaken rebellion, but this girl? She reminds me of the things I felt so long ago, before the war. Care, compassion. Love?” the adventurer closed his entry with the question that would remain unanswered for ages to come, closed the book, then lay his head on the table and let himself drift off into a deep sleep.');
		message.channel.send('“Adrian?” the adventurer was met by a thud at his door. He was no longer asleep on his table, instead he lay on the second level of an old, rusted metal bunk bed. The voice was that of another man, of similar age to himself. He kicked the blanket off his bed and began to sit up. His robotic leg was no longer metallic, but was now instead a human leg again, one of flesh and bone. It was another dream, it must have been. The door creaked open, and a head of a boy, no older than sixteen, popped in. “Adrian?” he said with a stern look on his face, “It’s time to go.” His friend’s face was dark and blackened, his hair short, hardly even touching his ears, and he wore a bright white leather jacket, of which he had clearly just washed, as it reflected almost like a mirror.');
		message.channel.send('“Go? What? Where?” he replied, but his voice was higher and childish, not because he was trying to seem happy or immature, but because he had not yet aged.');
		message.channel.send('“Home. Get your stuff,” his friend closed the door and seemingly walked away. The adventurer turned, his bare legs dangling off the side of the bed. He hopped down, stumbling on the ground, but the ground was no longer the concrete floor of the room he had resided in before. It was the rough, coarse dirt of the wasteland. Barbed wire surrounded him, and he now held the end of a gun in his hand. Soldiers stood behind him, running forward into the gunfire. All the fire missed Adrian himself, but everyone that ran past him was shot down before they could reach the enemy lines. He did not remember when this happened, or where, but it all seemed familiar. His friend from the earlier segment of the dream lie dead beside him, mis gun cast aside with three shots straight through his chest. He looked back up, standing up completely, and in front of him stood another soldier, one of the Republic. No one else ran forward from behind him, he was the last one that stood. The soldier lifted his gun, aiming it at Adrian, but he was cut short before he could end it.');
		message.channel.send('There was a loud rasp at the door, and the adventurer woke up almost immediately. He glanced out the window, the sun had just risen, and it gleamed off the metal roofs of the other shacks. He stood up and pushed his chair in, then walked over to Carla, who was still asleep. He took a blanket from a small bedside stand and cast it over her softly, gently, then walked over towards the door to greet his visitor. He opened the door quickly, and in front of him stood another rebel guard, with lighter gear, a very young man, probably a brand new recruit. “Sir, you’re wanted in the Council immediately,” he said in a quiet, nervous voice.');

		message.channel.send('“Captain Reynolds.”');
		message.channel.send('“What for?”');

		message.channel.send('“So be it.”');
		message.channel.send('Adrian stepped outside, closing the door behind him, and walked back down the steps slowly. His house was very close to the Council Hall, only two or three shacks away. The Hall was the largest building in the city: it’s walls were made of the cleanest metal in the city, and flags were hung on poles every few feet, each one representing a different settlement that had joined the Rebellion, every one completely different from the one next to it, some dark red, others bright blue, and some purely white aside from a small detail in the middle. In the middle of the building there was a giant flag stood directly above the double doors to the Hall: the flag of the Western Rebellion itself. There was a massive, metallic looking bird with a white marking on it’s chest perched on the leftern most flagpole, seemingly staring straight at the adventurer. The bird looked sideways at him for a moment, then it’s eyes lit up yellow and it flew away, into the distance.');
		message.channel.send('The doors were opened a slight bit, enough for someone to see the immense table where the Council met, and there must not have been an active meeting, for the table was almost bare aside from a few of the head members sitting at it. Guards with large assault rifles were assigned to each door, holding them at the ready in case someone threatened the Council, and they both saluted upon seeing the adventurer. He walked inside, closing the door behind him as he did so. The Hall was a dark and single roomed, the only light coming from the occasional lantern hung on columns along the wall. In the center stood a massive table with seven seats, five for the cities that had joined the Western Rebellion, one for General Lucas Gerhardt, the head of military, and the final for Captain Jane Reynolds herself, the leader of the Western Rebellion. She wasn’t the head of the entire rebellion, there was still the military masterminds from Massachusetts that she served under, but even Adrian, a man hardly under the members of the council of the Rebellion, knew very little about them, aside from the fact that without them, their whole rebellion would have been run over by this point. Only Gerhardt and Reynolds were seated at the Council now, Reynolds at the seat farthest down, in the center of the table, while Gerhardt was in the chair to the left of her, speaking softly to her. Neither of them noticed the adventurer’s arrival. They spoke quietly, seemingly looking at an old, blood stained paper between them, probably a map, and nothing they said was audible, it appeared that they were merely mumbling gibberish. Jane looked up and noticed Adrian, and quickly folded up the map, as though there was something she wished to hide from him. “Captain Reynolds,” the adventurer said, saluting.');
		message.channel.send('“Adrian Bauer, we meet again. I wish it were in better terms but your failure to deal with Cassius is…  scarring to us, to say the least,” the captain said, as she stood up to meet him towards the entrance.');

		message.channel.send('“I thought so, yes.”');
		message.channel.send('“There isn’t,” he paused, holding up his hand to stop her from speaking, “I want out. Let me out, I’ve worked under this damned rebellion for seven years, longer than either of you have! I want to leave, to be free,”');
		message.channel.send('The captain appeared to be taken aback, surprised at his sudden feelings. “So I annexed that station for nothing? You think I took that just for a territorial power? Do you have any ideas of the lives I spent? You were in there for a week!” she was almost yelling, and she paused for a moment before calming down, “You can’t just leave. I won’t let you.”');
		message.channel.send('“No, I’m leaving,” the adventurer turned around and started for the door.');
		message.channel.send('“Then what about the girl?” she shouted after him, “Leave her here and let her die as they take over? Let them take her in shackles and make her work on their damned zeppelins? Are you just gonna stay here and-”');
		message.channel.send('“How do you know about her?”');
		message.channel.send('“That’s not what matters right now. Nothing is going to matter if this rebellion falls apart, and it’ll all be because of you!”');
		message.channel.send('“I am one man on a chessboard with thousands of pawns. Find another piece.”');
		message.channel.send('“Who then? Take one of the recruits? Little kids that only serve for their freedom and to free their families? They hardly know how to aim a gun, I can’t throw them alone into the fires of the Republic, it’s a death sentence!”');

		message.channel.send('“Fine then. Leave. Let them take over. We’ll just run back with what we can, hoping that they don’t come after us, leaving some behind to get captured so they don’t catch up to the rest of us.

		message.channel.send('“No. I won’t let you-”');
		message.channel.send('“Then help us. There’s no other way. I’m not going to kill you, nor her,” she said sternly, yet calmly, “But they will.”');

I will fight ‘til the last drop of blood leaves my body, but I’m not your pawn anymore.”');
		message.channel.send('“Then where will you go? Run off and hope the Zeppelin searchlights don’t catch you as you and the girl make a break for it? Hopping from station to station, settlement to settlement, praying that the Republic doesn’t annex them like they did so many others?”');
		message.channel.send('“What is it you want from me?”');
		message.channel.send('“Are you staying or leaving?”');
		message.channel.send('The adventurer paused for a moment, considering the choice. “What does it matter? I want to hear out your ‘plan’ before I commit myself to another one of your damned suicide missions!”');
		message.channel.send('“It’s not a suicide mission, not for you anyway, but I can’t say more than that until you commit.”');
		message.channel.send('“When do I have to make a choice by?”');
		message.channel.send('“There’s no deadline, only the looming threat of the growing Republic. They make the deadlines, not me. I simply,” she pauses, “try to push the deadlines back a bit.”');
		message.channel.send('“Give me until the morning, I’ll make my choice then,” the adventurer stated firmly. He turned around and walked back out through the entrance, jogging, almost sprinting, to get away from there. He hated them, that damned Council, nothing more than a bunch of old men sitting in old wooden chairs playing chess, except the pieces were real men, hundreds of them, and he was only just a pawn. In his head he had already made his choice: he would go on the mission, whatever they sent him out to, and simply hope for the best. But it wasn’t just that simple. His thoughts were quickly cut short as he began walking up the steps towards his house, the girl was standing outside, with his gasmask thrown over her shoulder. She was wearing a leather jacket, like the one he wore, but it wasn’t his, it was far too small, but it was still too big for her. Under it she had the same blue dress on, but it was much cleaner than it had been the night before. She didn’t notice him at first, she was too busy staring at the Detroit skyline, entranced by the falling skyscrapers that still touched the edge of the world. He walked up beside her, leaning over the balcony, but she still took no notice him, totally entranced by the distant ruins. He looked out at the city for a moment, trying to find out what had intrigued her so much. “Those… things. Flying above the city,” she said, staring deeply into them, acknowledging Adrian’s presence but not caring enough to face him, “What are they?” “Republic zeppelins. Giant, flying blimps. Searching the cities for anything they don’t like. Massive behemoths,” the adventurer said, trying to come up with a simple response that she could understand, “Hellish things. I hate them, the Rebellion fears them.”');
		message.channel.send('“Do you?”');
		message.channel.send('“Do I what?”');
		message.channel.send('“Fear them.”');
		message.channel.send('“Fear is hard to describe. I’ve never been in one, I’ve never seen one all too close. Only once… I was wandering the streets of the city and one of their searchlights caught me. I hate them, we should send them all into the ground. So no, I don’t fear them, I guess.”');
		message.channel.send('The girl paused in silence for another moment, “My father, he worked on them. There were posters of them… scattered across his room. He never let me look at them, just told me I would see them in a few years once I was old enough to work on them. I think my mom… I dont think she liked them. Hated the idea of always being watched over… but it didn’t last for very long.”');
		message.channel.send('The two stared in silence for a moment. If one were to look at it, it would seem tense, but really it was a calm, peaceful moment, especially in the eyes of Adrian. The sun was still low in the sky, only slightly above the skyline, still early in the day. “Where did you get that jacket?” he said, breaking the silence.');
		message.channel.send('The girl gave away her mad grin again, and looked at the adventurer happily. “I found it in your closet, way in the back, under a couple pairs of shoes. It was old and dusted so a went and washed it in the pond over there, same with my dress,” she spun happily, showing herself off politely. The adventurer thought for a moment. Had he really been fighting in the war since he was small enough to fit a jacket the size of a little girl’s? He had lived here for eight years, since before the war started. And had he really been in the council hall that long? Long enough for the girl to wake up and find the jacket and find the pond and wash it all and dry it all and put it all on? It must have been quite a long debate he had had with the captain. ');
		message.channel.send('“I want to see what’s outside. Beyond the wall,” she broke the silence once more, “I never left that station in my entire life. And now I’m here… and I just feel like I’ve been trapped again. It’s better here than it is at Chilltop, obviously, and you’ve been better to me than my father ever was, but I still want to be free.” The adventurer sighed in despair, he didn’t know how to let her “be free” without letting her get killed, and simply put his hand on her back.');
		message.channel.send('“I’ll let you be free,” he paused for a moment, “You know I lied to you, back on our way here. About who I was. Matthew Hark doesn’t exist.”');
		message.channel.send('“I know. I asked around. While you were gone. You’re Adrian Bauer. That man wanted dead by the Republic. One of so many, but you’re at the top of all those lists.”');
		message.channel.send('“I’ve done a lot of things, Carla. I regret a lot of them, but I certainly can’t undo them. Maybe someday I can fix it all,” he said, taking his hand away and turning away, walking inside his home.');
		message.channel.send('The adventurer sat down in the chair, his stomach was rumbling; he hadn’t eaten in God knows how long. He walked over towards the fridge, and he was glad to see that it was still filled with whatever he had left in it before his adventure. He took out a handful of hard boiled eggs and a bottle of unlabeled sodas, sold to him by that old man in the market across the street from his house. He crammed one of the eggs into his mouth, almost savagely, and closed the fridge behind him as he returned to the table. He pushed the chair back and leaned back, kicking his feet onto the table as he sat back and drank, looking like a drunkard. But his feet didn’t touch the table, they instead touched a soft, leather surface. He leaned the chair forward again and took his legs off to see what it was. It was the book, though it was not at all as he had left it, and the pen was cast aside next to it. He opened it to the first page, reading over what he had wrote. It was all the same as it was before. But there was something else, at the bottom, after his last comment about the girl. It was something in a little kid’s handwriting, a sloppy mix of print and script, obviously Carla’s handwriting. The phrase was short, all it read was, “I love you to.” He smiled happily, but his smile felt forced. He felt like the girl was too good for her, too pure, too kind, too young.');
		message.channel.send('He was an old man, a savage, an adventurer, a survivor, a killer, not a father. But he had taken her in anyway, not knowing what he had gotten himself into. He was her responsibility now. He closed the book with the pen inside and put it back into his pocket, going back outside to be with his little girl again. She wasn’t at the balcony anymore, and he peered off the edge of the balcony, searching for her. She was running about in the street, happy, and laughing. So this is what his rebellion was fighting for, the joy of the children. He sat on the steps, staring at the city skyline and the zeppelins that flew above it, thinking about the thousands of things that flew through his mind. And he would have kept thinking about all that, had the screaming not started.');
		message.channel.send('The adventurer hopped up and jumped down the stairs. The city was in panic, people running left and right in despair, most of them aiming towards the back, to the Council’s hall. The adventurer took out his gun from his pocket and ran towards the gate. Flames rose from it, flying away after the smoke, reaching at the sky, and gunshots made themselves well known even above the screaming. The sky began to turn black with smoke, but the adventurer ran still closer to where it came from. The crowd became noticeably thinner, and armed guards began to line themselves in front of where the adventurer stood, aiming down at where the gate had been. The gunshots still became louder, and they began to fly towards the adventurer and the guards, even towards some of the civilians. The bullets had hit some people, leaving some dead, with a hole straight through the eyes and a blank look on their faces, others with just a bullet in the chest, simply lying there, left to die. One of the soldiers lay dead next to him, and the adventurer threw his rusty old revolver to the ground and picked up the soldier’s automatic, firing into the smoke aimlessly, hoping to hit something, anything. He began to walk backwards, and the first man began to emerge from the smoke. A tall man in a fireproof jacket and a gas mask, holding a massive flamethrower. Another followed after him, this one holding an assault rifle, and countless more followed after him. The adventurer fired a few shots towards them, taking one or two of them out, but for every one he killed, three more emerged from the flames. The adventurer sprinted back, hoping to find the girl. The crowd became denser as he ran farther back, the entire city was in flames, houses being ripped apart by the thick flames and gunfire. Hardly anyone could manage to hide from the gunfire, but still the adventurer did. “Carla!” he screamed at the top of his lungs, hoping to find her.');
		message.channel.send('She was nowhere to be seen. He kept running back towards the hall, shouting her name, praying that she was okay, that she had escaped the flames like he had. He felt an arm grasp at his leg, but it wasn’t the girl, it was a man, shot through the side of his mouth and his thigh, holding on to the adventurer for dear life. He kicked him off and kept moving. His actions were unjust but not unjustifiable. He pointed the gun towards the flame and let loose another few shots, then continued to sprint towards the hall. She was there, outsider the hall, holding one of the dead guard’s guns, but she clearly had no idea how to use it. There was no way, she took notice of him, and he picked her up and threw her over his shoulders again. The gunfire got closer, bullets flying past them every second, almost hitting the girl in the neck. One struck a man standing next to them, and Carla yelped in fear and turned away from his corpse. Adrian sprinted inside what had been the hall and looked for his commanders. Jane was there, holding another one of the officer’s guns, but she was kneeling down next to someone, trying to help them. He ran closer, and the man was no longer some unknown figure, it was General Gerhardt. With one or two swift bullets, the Republic had taken out the one military leader the Rebellion had had, besides the adventurer himself. He was shot twice, straight through the chest both times. Adrian put down the girl next to him, gesturing for her to wait a moment. He grabbed at the captain’s shoulder, trying to pull her away from Gerhardt. “It’s not worth it! He’s dead!” he shouted, “We have to go!”');
		message.channel.send('The men in the masks came ever closer, and the adventurer pointed his gun towards the crowd of them and opened fire on them, killing only a small fraction of their horde. He realized it was hopeless. “Take the girl!” he shouted at Jane, who had started to get up from the general’s corpse, and was running away, out by where the back wall of the Council Hall. She stopped and looked at him, then stared at the girl and took her hand. The adventurer stopped them before they could run off. “I’ll come back for you,” he said reassuringly, taking no notice to the fact that she was sobbing like never before. He kissed her on the forehead, and before either her or the captain could say a word to them, he ran towards the Hall’s entrance, to fight alongside whatever was left of the guards at the Capital.');
		message.channel.send('The screaming had quieted down; there were less people to scream now, and less people to shoot. There were still a few people, citizens, in front of the hall, running from the closing in wave. Only a handful of them were able to get past the line. Some made a hiding place for themselves in the ruins of the buildings, hoping that they wouldn’t be found out, hoping that the few soldiers left would be able to stand up to the Republic swarm and push them back. But the adventurer had put it well into his head, there was no repairing from this attack, only escaping. He stood next to the other fighters, firing into the eternal mob. He hit countless men, but only a few of them fell from the shots, and those that did were simply replaced by others. The crowd of people was gone now, no civilians were left, there was only the guard that stood to defend their home, and the invaders that came to claim it for their own. Every man had hatred in his eyes there, there was no man that aimed down the sights of their guns with the hopes to live. They simply wished that their family could escape farther west, away from the grip of the Republic. One of the soldiers grinned widely, like a madman, laughing as he shot towards the enemy. “My time has come!” he shouted, realizing defeat as his gun was empty. The man threw the gun to the ground and ran towards the crowd with his fists clenched, hoping to kill one last soldier before he fell. He was shot down the second he stepped down from the Hall’s steps. The adventurer glanced behind him. There was no one behind him, all the people had retreated, and only two soldiers stood next to him, both short and young. “They’re gone! We have to leave!” Adrian shouted, “Now!”');
		message.channel.send('One of the enemy soldiers began to walk up the Hall’s stairs, but the adventurer filled his body with whatever was left in his gun, at least a dozen bullets. He took another soldier’s gun from the ground, kicking the dead man’s arm to the side as he did so. Another two soldiers began to come up the stairs, and in defeat, the adventurer turned around and began sprinting towards the forest behind the hall. One of the rebels followed him, and the other one was caught with bullets in the back as he tried to retreat. Bullets shot through the broken down halls, hitting the ground or the walls, hardly missing the adventurer and his new companion. They jumped out a large hole in the back of the Hall, and they fell a few feet to the ground, sprinting into the forest to the south. The trees were thick and close together, it was almost impossible to be followed this way, and the grass was short, hardly anything more than dirt. The adventurer glanced back at the Hall for a moment before the trees became too thick: there were a few soldiers looking out through the hole in the hall, but they did not hop out; their job must have already been done. He turned back around and began walking at a more casual pace, grabbing the new companion harshly by the shoulder, gesturing for him to do the same. Where were they to go? There was nowhere to the south, and if the Republic had taken Seditionem Ventum, one could only guess that the other settlements were already gone.');
		message.channel.send('They had to go deeper into the forest. Walking at a slower, calmer rate, the adventurer finally got a more sturdy vision of his companion. He was a short kid, probably not even a soldier, but he had a few hairs growing on his face, so he couldn’t have been that young, fifteen, maybe. His hair was long and uncombed, kept dirty, it was a dark shade of brown. He had on a pair of jeans and a long sleeve shirt, no armor but a chestpiece and a shoulder pad on his right arm. He wore old gloves, but they weren’t military gloves, just worker’s gloves or maybe even gloves from an old sport. He held an automatic in one hand, holding his hand against his other arm, which appeared to be stained a deep red. He hadn’t been shot, but he had still been injured somehow. “Kid?” the adventurer said, trying to get his attention. The soldier looked up at the adventurer, who was a few feet ahead of him now. “Yes?” he said, with an angry attitude that showed he was clearly not in the mood to talk, but the Adrian had no intention of letting him stay in silence, “What do you want?” he said keeping his head down.');
		message.channel.send('“What I want?” the adventurer replied in anger, “I wanna live long enough to sleep tonight. What about you?”');
		message.channel.send('“Keep the sarcasm to yourself, old man. I shouldn’t have even run, Should have given the others more time to,” he drifted off, mumbling to himself. There was a long moment of silence between the two of them, again, as they continued walking.');
		message.channel.send('What do we do?” the adventurer broke the silence, but the soldier merely shrugged, as though trying to gesture for him to stop talking. The adventurer looked at him again, and his face was red, with a tear running down the side of his face. Adrian looked up again and continued walking, he must have lost something back there, something that the he couldn’t simply replace. But everyone loses irreplaceable things in war, the adventurer was used to this, the other soldier must become so as well, if he wished to keep sane.');
		message.channel.send('“You’re the old man, the general, you’re supposed to know what to do,” the soldier scowled deeply, showing deep and obvious hatred for the people who lead him.

		message.channel.send('“So what!? We just camp down and wait for them to find us!?”');
		message.channel.send('“We walk west until nightfall, then… well, yes. We rest.”');
		message.channel.send('“It’s suicide!”');
		message.channel.send('“Our life is suicide at this point! Any turn, any choice we take, it all leads to death. I’m simply trying to find the one path that doesn’t.”');
		message.channel.send('The soldier sighed, realizing that his superior was right, and they continued to walk in silence. The forest was thick, with broken branches and leaves coating the grass and dirt on the ground. There was rain coming down now, nothing more than a light drizzle, and it seemed to fit well the mood held between the two. “We’ve gone far enough,” the adventurer finally said after at least four hours of westward walking, as they finally made a stop in a small opening in the woods. He sat down on a large rock and laid his gun at his side, turning the safety back on. He looked towards the soldier, who was sitting in silence across from him, looking down at the ground, poking it with the barrel of his gun. “What’s your name kid?” the adventurer said, trying to be polite. He wanted to know the man who he thought he was going to die with. “Alex. Alex Knightley,” he said simply, still looking down, “And I’m no kid. I’m sixteen. Plus, who could be a kid after seeing all that.”');

		message.channel.send('“Yes,” the soldier interrupted, already knowing what the adventurer was going to ask.');
		message.channel.send('“What happened?”');
		message.channel.send('The soldier shrugged. “It all happened so fast, a blur, I couldn’t… The screams… I…” he stopped talking and began to noticeably weep.');
		message.channel.send('“Sorry,” the adventurer said, getting up from his rock and kicking some of the leaves and sticks on the ground, making a rough patch where there was only dirt. He piled some of the leaves into a ball, only the dry, rough ones, and started rubbing the dry sticks together. The rain was still coming down, but it wasn’t enough to make making the fire impossible. Once he had accumulated a large enough pile, he took some small rocks and began rubbing them against each other. A few sparks came out, but nowhere near enough to start a fire. The soldier came over to the adventurer, pulling something small out of his pocket. “Take this,” he said, holding out a small package of matches, “Grandma gave it to me when the city started burning. Knew I would need it.” The adventurer solemnly nodded and took the package, striking a match against the side of the package, and throwing it into the fire. “Did she make it?” the adventurer asked the question, wishing he didn’t.');
		message.channel.send('“Is a bullet to the head enough to kill an old lady?” the soldier said sarcastically, sitting back on his rock. “Sorry,” the adventurer said quietly, trying not to anger or disturb the soldier, “Almost better she die than-”');

Only the side you shot with and the side you shoot at.” Alex never responded, and he laid his head into his hands, perhaps to think, perhaps simply to bathe in the deep abyss of silence. Silence was better sometimes, especially for someone as young as him. The rain had stopped now, and the sun was already touching the horizon, stars gleaming across the sky. It would have been a beautiful sight, if only the stars to the east weren’t clotted out by the smoke of the burning city. The adventurer laid on the ground and laid his head on the rock, putting his gun on his chest and his gas mask at his side, and closed his eyes, and placing his book behind his head, letting it serve as a pillow. For a moment his eyes opened, and above him he saw two, red eyes, belonging to some monstrous bird, staring right at him. He stared at the bird for a moment, but after a while he decided it wasn’t a threat, and he went right off to sleep.');
		message.channel.send('The adventurer woke up slowly, still laying on his book. He was no longer in the thick forest, laying against the rock, but was back at home, in Seditionem Ventum. Perhaps the hellish fires were just another dream. He looked behind him for the girl, but she was not inside. The sun had already risen, and the day was at it’s peak. Why hadn’t someone come to get him? The house was nice and organized, not like it had been at all the night before. Adrian stumbled out of the chair and peered out the window: it was insanely fogged up with smoke and dust, but through what he could see, the light he had seen before was not from the sun, but the fires of the burning city. He took his book from the table and kicked down the door, sprinting down the steps. “Carla!” he shouted, but to no avail. The city was in chaos, there were noises of gunfire and explosions in the distance, alongside terrifying, ear piercing screams. But then he found her, right in the middle of the road, in the middle of the city, simply sitting, wearing that same, dirty blue dress. She had her hands in her face again, she was crying loudly, noticeably so. He put his hand on her shoulder, but she shoved it away before it was there for very long. “Carla, we have to go!” he shouted angrily at her. She merely shook her head at him slowly, then after realizing he was not going to leave, she looked up and faced him. “It’s all your fault!” she yelled, as she stood up and ran towards the entrance. The adventurer reached out for her to come back, but she did not so much as glance at him. The sky turned pitch black, and thunder roared. But it was not thunder. It was the hellish, metallic laugh of the damned Plague Doctor, laughing at his defeat. Then he woke up.');
		message.channel.send('He sat straight up, picking up the gun from his chest and aiming it outwards as he did so. He jumped to his feet and looked around. Suddenly he came to the realization that it was just a dream, and he slowed his actions again and came to his senses. He was soaked in sweat from head to toe, the gun practically sliding from his hands, with some of it getting into his eyes, making them burn with a stinging pain. He looked up, and the moon was still high in the sky, almost directly overhead, shaped like a perfect crescent. The stars still shone bright, and those that were blocked out by the flames to the east were now perfectly clear. A memory struck the edge of his mind like a match, one of where he laid out on the hills in the night with someone. The memory was crude, from before the war, before his time, and if he tried to grab at it too hard it swam away, back into the pits of his mind. He wished he could grab those memories with a tight fist, hold onto them and never let them go, to become one with them. To live in the dream of what he used to be before the war, a simply life. But his life was no longer one of dreams, but was now instead one of nightmares. He tried again to reach towards the memory, and was now able to grasp at it more firmly, but there was nothing. All he could remember were the stars. Perhaps it was just his mind playing tricks on him as he stood there in confusion, laughing with that same damned metallic laugh as Devitt did. He shook his head to get the memory out of his mind, deciding that it was better to focus on what lied ahead of him instead of what he had left behind him, under seven years of war and countless corpses of soldiers of the Republic. But what did lay ahead of him?');
		message.channel.send('There was nothing, nowhere for him and Alex to run off to and hide, nowhere for them to go to to regroup with whatever was left of the Western Rebellion. He sat back down again, letting his thoughts pile upwards and upwards, facing the still burning fire in between himself and the soldier. The thoughts all seemed to collect on one thing: the dream. “All your fault,” the words of the girl in the dream echoed inside his mind. What had he done? Was it really his fault? What if he was followed? What if they were only a block behind him and the girl the whole time? The adventurer contained his urge to shout in anger, in realization. It was all his fault, he had killed them. With his own hand he had brought down the Western Rebellion, with his own swing he had killed countless innocents and ended a war in favor of the hellishly inhumane Republic. The memories struck him again, the screaming, the crying, the fire, the gunshots. These ones were not so hard to grasp onto, but he did not wish to take hold of them he wanted to push them away, but they still forced their way forward. He looked across the fire, at the soldier, who was still dead asleep. He must have been exhausted, but the adventurer, fighting for as long as he had, had learned to live without sleep. He took the book up from the ground and opened it. He turned through the pages quickly, trying to shield his eyes from the note from the little girl. He knew it existed, but he wanted to hide it from himself, so he could pretend in his mind that the girl didn’t exist. He opened to the second page in the book, the one after his first entry, put the pen down, and began to let his thoughts flow.');

The more I think about it, the more I realize how right she was. I hate myself for it, and I hate myself for letting me get too attached to her. I fight on the losing side of a war, everything that lies behind me has been buried in a grave ten feet down, and the only thing ahead of me is a desolate wasteland. But there is a tree at the end of the wasteland, and it grows, tall and healthy and green. And that tree is death, a peaceful death, where I know I can die, but that the parts of me that will live on will be able to live in the same peace. But the path to the tree is a long, winding road, and there are countless other false roads that merely lead to more graves, more death,” Adrian finished his statement and paused, reading over what he had written, questioning himself and his sanity. He slammed the book closed and shook his head again, trying to stop himself from thinking. The war had broken him, poisoned him, and the only way to reject the poison was to reject his thought. To become a mindless soldier, simply killing any in his path for the chess players above him. He put the book back into his pocket and stood up, stomping out the fire with his foot. The soldier’s eyes blinked open suddenly, tired yet alert, scared as well.');
		message.channel.send('“What, who…” he mumbled quietly. The adventurer put his hand down to help the soldier up, “Come on. It’s time to go.” The soldier took his hand and stood up slowly, still not fully realizing what was going on. There was a distant howl, like one of a wolf or a rabid dog, or maybe even a trained dog. A dog trained to hunt. He picked up his gun and his gas mask from the ground behind him where he laid and began walking further westwards, though at a slower pace as to allow for Alex to catch up with him. There was another howl, this time closer, obviously following them. But it was clear now, it was not just another pack of rabid animals, like the one that had chased he and the girl before. The howls were loud and clear, but it’s footsteps were silent. A pack of animals would make a loud thumping noise as they pursued their prey, this one came alone. It was howling to it’s owners, the ones who had tamed it. The Republic.');
		message.channel.send('“Run, now!” the adventurer shouted at Alex. He regretted the his shouts almost instantly, as another howl came from behind them. The footsteps of the animal were clear now, but there was something else alongside them. Other footsteps, human ones, footsteps of soldiers in heavy metal gear. The adventurer looked to his side, and he saw out of the corner of his eye the dog sprinting to get in front of them, cut them off. He looked behind himself, but there was no one following him. Not Alex, not the Republic, not dogs, no one. He held his gun and aimed it by where the dog was sprinting beside him, but the bullets hit nothing more than leaves and dirt. He looked back again, there were now figures on the horizon, hooded ones like the ones that took Seditionem Ventum and burned it. The figures were sprinting towards him now. He turned back around and began to sprint forward, but the dog jumped out at him. He aimed the gun at the beast, but no explosion sounded, nor did any bullets come out. The dog barked and growled at him, but did not get too close. He turned around again, hoping to run away from the mad dog, away to anywhere, to anything out of the damned Republic’s grasp. But he couldn’t run, for the men in the gas masks were there was well, their guns pointed towards the adventurer. A whole brigade of them, over a dozen stood there. But there was another set of footsteps, these ones not human. And something else, that evil, metallic laugh, pierced through the ears of all that heard it. Three men emerged from the semicircle formed around the adventurer, two of hatred, one of fear. Cassius Devitt stood at the left of the group with his hands behind his back, his cape long and his hood up, his plague doctor’s mask on as per usual.');
		message.channel.send('To the right of him stood Alex Knightley, his clothes torn apart and ripped, his armor cast aside as well as his weapons. His arms were held behind his back by another one of the Doctor’s creations that stood at the soldier’s right. This one had two robotic legs and one robotic hand, and also had similar wires throughout his arms and legs and head. A few wires connected to his chest, one seemed to clearly connect to his heart, but it was covered by a chestpiece, on which the designation X-B389 was inscribed in white paint. The adventurer threw his gun down in defeat and stood there angrily, looking down at the ground in defeat in a similar way to how Alex did, and closed his eyes. “Just end it already, Devitt,” he said quietly, only loud enough for the Doctor to hear. The dog ran out from behind him and stood next to Cassius, his owner. The Doctor stood in front of the adventurer and looked him dead in the eyes, so close that he could feel the breath coming from the respirator on his mask. “Why would we do that, Mr. Bauer?” he spoke with the metallic voice, the same one that laughed at him in his nightmares,  “You have done a decent chunk of damage to our efforts, but really, did you think we couldn’t have just come and burnt it all down at any moment? The Executor is tired of letting us play our little games, Bauer, your Rebellion and my Republic. He says it’s caused enough damage, and, though I disagree with him, I’m not a man to disobey orders.

		message.channel.send('“Classified. It was a fun little game well it lasted Mr. Bauer,” the Doctor began to back up into his formation with B389 and Alex, “But I’m afraid I’m going to have to end it.

We’re not done! We’ve built a fire you can’t put out!” The Doctor aimed his gun away from the adventurer and walked over to the young soldier, who was still screaming. Either the Rebellion’s propaganda really got too far into his head, or he was just trying to make time in hopes that they may be rescued. The adventurer glanced behind himself, and there was no one there, only the woods. He quickly looked back towards the Doctor to avoid suspicion. “What are you on about?” the Doctor looked at Alex with anger and confusion, “You were never anything more than a crude little game to us!”');

The shot of Cassius’ revolver echoed through the forest and shook the trees, but the ear piercing shot was not enough to make the adventurer stumble from his path. More echoing shots followed, but they were of quieter shots, those from assault rifles. The shots hit the trees and the ground, and whizzed past his shoulder and between his legs, but still none of them hit the adventurer himself. Footsteps followed after him, but they were far behind him, and they were still becoming more distant. There was nowhere to run to, but he kept on running. Running forward, running farther to the west, away from the Republic. He took the knife out of his pocket, still sprinting, and began to run with it in his hand, holding it facing backwards towards the enemies that followed him.');

The sun was high in the sky now, shining down on his face, blurring his vision. His legs were exhausted, they could no longer run any longer, even his robotic one seemed to be weary from overuse. He slowed down for a moment and glanced behind him, seeing if his followers were still behind him. But there was nothing there, no one behind him, and he felt relief flow through him. He sighed from relief and fell to the ground from exhaustion, immediately falling asleep.');
		message.channel.send('He woke up standing somehow, no longer in a forest, but on a barren hill, staring into the city in the distance. It was clearly the ruins of Detroit, he recognized the tall, collapsing buildings, but it was much farther away than he had ever seen it before. There was a thick forest in between himself and the city, and a road far to his left, to the south, running towards the city, the same one where Seditionem Ventum had once stood. He knew it was a dream, but there was no escape from it, one could easily set up the physical prisons made by man, but no man could escape the mental ones made by himself. He turned around and looked behind him, and he faced a tall, metal tower with a rusted antenna, that sat alongside an old brick building, the roof of which had collapsed on itself partially. He went to his holster and took out the knife, holding it backwards again as he walked towards the tower, it seemed to call him towards it. There were voices coming from the antenna at the top, beckoning him to listen. They spoke in an inaudible muttering, hardly loud enough to be heard, and despite the adventurer’s approach, they did not become louder. He walked to the brick building, pushing a door out of the way and going inside. There was rubble on the floor, presumably from the crashed roof, but there were still lights on, it was still working. The mumbling grew louder, calling him towards a small radio in the back of the room. It sat on a table, with wires connecting it to ports on the wall, presumably ones that connected to the antenna. He walked over to the radio and put the knife back in his holster, picking up the headset and putting it on. He didn’t touch the radio at all, instead he only listened. There was nothing but mumbling, unrecognizable mumbling. “Hello?” he said softly into the microphone connected to the headset.');
		message.channel.send('The mumbling continued, as though they had not heard him speak at all. He began to turn the knobs on the radio, hoping that maybe one would pick up the mumbling more clearly.

The mumbling stopped for a moment, as though it were thinking. But at last it finally spoke. “It was all your fault,” it said, in the quiet, depressed voice of a little girl, his little girl, Carla. The words echoed through his mind, and the walls began to tear themselves apart, breaking, falling over as though they were simply pieces of cardboard made for a children’s play. Reality itself broke in this way, the sky, the ground beneath him, the city in the distance, until all that remained was an empty white plain where the adventurer stood. And the plain began to formulate in front of him, forming a human. It was unrecognizable, colorless, genderless, but it’s details were steadily growing each second. The figure was pointing a gun towards the adventurer, and he immediately knew who it was. The figure’s face began to detail, but it wasn’t a face, it was a plague doctor’s beak, sticking out, with evil, black eyes that held nothing but infinite darkness. The color began to take form, and he looked the same as he did in the forest. As this happened, his same metallic laugh began to echo through the infinite white plain. “It was a fun game while it lasted, Mr. Bauer,” the metallic voice did not come from the Doctor himself, but from the infinite white plain instead, “But I’m afraid it’s time to put an end to it, Checkmate.”');

He put his hands under his chest and pushed himself up off the ground, standing up with little strength and a lot of effort. He stood crookedly, with hardly any strength to stand, he looked around, trying to find somewhere to sit. But there was nowhere, so his legs were forced to remain standing. He began to come to his senses and looked around, trying to find where to walk to next. Nothing but trees to the north, nothing but trees to the south, nothing but trees and the distant ruins of old Detroit to the east, but to the west stood a massive radio tower, atop a small hill, with an antenna that pierced the sky. He felt some remembrance of this place, but he knew he had never been here before, not in his physical form. A dream, probably, but dreams were the hardest memories to reach out to, burrowing far into the back of his mind, back so far they were impossible to reach. He inspected the tower more closely, and it seemed to be empty, uninhabited, neither by humans nor wild beasts. There was a small reactor to the side of it, with lights that lit up the area around them, and a little engine that belched smoke. He began to walk up to it, almost limping as he did, as his robotic leg was able to carry him much easier than his human one. The hill was steep, and with his exhausted legs the trip was made nearly impossible, but he still managed to pull himself upwards. ');

Yet still he continued to climb, over rock and dirt, reaching towards the tip of the hill. Ten more steps, nine more steps. The pain in his leg was becoming harsher and harsher. Eight more steps, seven more steps. His eyes were blurred to the point where he could no longer see what was ahead of him. Six more steps, five more steps, four more steps. How long had it been since he had last eaten? Since he had last had a drink of water? He needed nourishment, he needed energy, he needed… peace. Three steps, two steps. His mind had completely blacked out, no thought moved through his head any longer, all he thought about was climbing up, all he felt was rough dirt and a deep gash in his leg. One step.

There was someone else in the room with him, their back faced to him, they were busy working on something on a counter. The person, a girl, appeared to be a teenager, from what he could tell from the glass behind her. Her hair was long and it touched her shoulders, and it had a dark brown tint to it. She had pale skin, but there was a tint of sun that lightly coated most of it. He walked up beside her, and, taking no notice to her, looked at himself in the mirror. He was much younger than he was now, with no noticeable scars along his face, and shorter hair with a lighter skin tone. She looked at him briefly, and he looked down at what he was doing. She held a small tray, with what appeared to be brown dough on it: she was making cookies. ');

Avery, the name randomly popped up in his head, but he had no idea where it came from.

		message.channel.send('“Yes,” Adrian spoke, but his voice was not the same. It was young and higher pitched, though not a child’s, it was not the voice of a man who had been through seven years of war on the losing side.

He took orders, he gave orders, he saved lives, he ended them. Compassion and love were practically unknown to him, they had been scratched out with mercilessness and hatred. Yet this memory gave his mind peace that he had not felt, had not known, in years. He took another piece of the dough, trying to form it again, this time producing a more sophisticated blob. He sighed, at least it was better than the one he had made first, and put it onto the tray she held. But the tray wasn’t there, and neither was the girl, and the adventurer stood again in the ruins of Seditionem Ventum. No, it wasn’t Seditionem Ventum, it was somewhere else, some other city. It seemed to be midday, but the smoke from the burning city clouded out wherever the sun had been. He remembered this day all too well: it was the day the war had begun, the Fall of New Arkney. That was how he remembered Avery; he had fought alongside her as the walls crumbled, the first of many times he shot a man to kill. But he had remembered her as nothing more than another that had died to the war. Nothing more, seven years of war had buried everything else deep into the back of his mind.');
		message.channel.send('She stood beside him, coated and dirt and holding an old revolver, like the one the adventurer himself used to use. She shot towards the approaching soldiers, and without even thinking, Adrian began to do the same. The shots echoed through whatever remained of the burning city, and even louder did the shots of the enemy’s guns. They shot towards the two of them, missing almost all the shots. But one caught the girl in the shoulder, and she crumbled to the ground. Before he could even see this, she was shot again, this time straight through the chest. He knelt down to try to help her, even though he knew there was no hope. She opened her mouth, trying to speak, but the words that came out were not hers, they were the words of the little girl from Chilltop station. “It was all your fault,” she said slowly, and she tilted her head to the side, closed her eyes, and died. The adventurer stood up and looked around him. The soldiers advancing upon him were no longer mere Republic soldiers, but were now all the Doctor himself. They did not simply don his gear, but they walked like he did, and spoke as he did, all slowly walking towards the adventurer with the same menacing pace. Two grabbed him by the arms, and despite his resistance, he was not able to free himself from them. “Bastards!” he shouted at them, but one of them simply covered his mouth with his hand and whispered to him. “Watch your language, Mr. Bauer,” one said, covering the adventurer’s mouth with his bloody, white glove. He could no longer breathe, and as hard as he tried to pull away from them, they wouldn’t let him go. They surrounded him completely, holding him still. He couldn’t breathe, he couldn’t move, he couldn’t see. His eyes were blurry from the lack of breath, nothing was distinguishable anymore. The only thing he could distinguish was the menacing metallic laugh, striking him once again. And when he could finally live no longer, he awoke from his dream.');
		message.channel.send('The adventurer moaned and rolled over onto his back as he slowly woke back up. The pain still shot up from his leg, but it no longer burned with the sharp feeling as it had before, and there was no longer any blur in his vision, nor exhaustion in his legs.

The building at the side was much larger than it seemed from the bottom of the hill, almost twice as tall as the man, and almost three or four times bigger than his house. He stepped through a massive hole in the wall, leading him into a large hall. The floor was covered in rubble, and the only light came through breaks and tears in the walls and roof, mostly from one massive hole in the roof. There were overturned tables left and right, some buried in rock, others simply lying there. There were some old skeletons lying beside some of them, some still seated in the chairs, but not a single one showed a sign of life, all of their skin and fat had been eaten away by the wildlife that ruled this land, or simply by time itself. Rats scurried around, carrying whatever little bits of food they could find, all of them scurrying away at the sight of the adventurer. One stayed, it’s fear seemingly extinguished by the overwhelming interest of whatever it smelled, but Adrian simply stepped on it with his robotic foot as he walked through the old hall.');

At least in the days of old, but the ‘days of old’ were tens if not hundreds of years ago. No one really knew what year it was, the month, or even the day. The Republic had made a calendar at some point, stating the year was simply “One” and that each year started with the anniversary of the founding of the Republic, meaning that they were on the year 158, or something around there. Their calendar said that the year was 370 days, but any book that the adventurer had ever read said that a year was 365 days. But maybe they were right, maybe the Earth’s timing just got screwed up when all the nukes fell. The adventurer himself never kept track of the year, he simply counted the days, and he had only done that ever since the war began. Every year was simply 365 days, no months, no Mondays or Tuesdays or anything like that, and he never held any kind of calendar, he simply kept track of the days in his head. 2514 days, six years and three hundred twenty four days since the war began. 2514 days of fighting for his life, losing part of him each day until there was nothing less.

		message.channel.send('He continued scanning the room, trying to find something of use. There was a large table in the back of the hall, not overturned like the others, but instead it held a large radio that sat there, with headphones dangling over the side. He picked up the headset and tried to listen, pressing random buttons on the radio as he did so. Almost every frequency he picked up simply played more Republic propaganda, boasting about the “freedom and equality and justice” it offered to the territories it controlled, and how it wished to recruit new men to “fight for the same equality for others”. If a slave had freedom, if a man against a firing squad is equal to the shooter, if justice is shown through the murder of civilians, their propaganda was honest. The propaganda blasted on numerous channels, at least five different frequencies, all speaking different languages: Spanish, Russian, German, French, and obviously English, all blasting loud enough to be heard as far as the distant ruins of Rhode Island. He set his head down on the desk for a moment, trying to pull his thoughts together. “In a stunning victory!” the man announcing the propaganda spoke, “The Republic of New Detroit has swiftly put an end to the Western Rebellion!

Whatever it was, they weren’t speaking English, it was some other, distant, forgotten language. “Et Occidentis rebellionem concitarunt non cecidit,” it spoke very quietly, “Non ædificabunt.” It was Latin the person was speaking, and he understood a small portion of it. Something about the Rebellion, that was certain, but who could it have been, and how did they find a radio? Latin was the language of the Rebellion, but very few knew to speak it fluently, most soldiers, like the adventurer himself, only knew short phrases and commands, even a few battle cries. “Quicquid reliquiae,” the voice on the radio spoke again, more loud and clear, this time easily overcasting the static, “Novum Arkney occurrence in mane.” The words spoken clearly said that whatever was left of the Rebellion was to meet up at New Arkney, a small, Republic controlled town to the north of the tower, at dawn. The adventurer almost died laughing at the idiocracy, he knew it was nothing more than a trap. The Republic wished to put an end to the war the same place it had begun, merely for symbolic reasons. He turned the knob on the radio again, trying to at least give himself some ability to think in his hopelessness. Deep down, he was searching for something on that radio, some sign that the Rebellion wasn’t totally gone, that there was still hope, that the girl hadn’t been returned to her merciless father, but he knew that there was no hope.');
		message.channel.send('The radio stayed in static now, nothing of any human language came through, and he simply sat there and laid his head down in hopelessness. There was something that played in the distance, he could barely hear it, but it was nothing more than some old jazz or music or something like that. He took the headphones off in defeat and laid back in his chair. The static grew louder, almost as though they wished for the adventurer to come back, calling towards him. He stood up from the desk and continued looking around, trying to find something. There was a small can of food lying on the ground, it smelled like garbage and it was probably older than he was, but he didn’t care, he picked it up and began to shovel it into his mouth. The beans were stale and dry, with disgusting mold all over them, so bad he practically spat them right out, but, being as hungry as he was, he forced them down. He threw the empty can to the side and continued looking, as a rat came over and dragged the can away, hoping there was something left in it. He walked over to a small coat rack on the wall, there was a single hoodie there, coated in layers of ash and dust, but still intact and wearable. The adventurer took the book out of his leather jacket and put it on the side, taking the jacket off and casting it to the side, putting on the new hood. He put the hood up, casting a shadow over his face, and continued searching. The sound of static from the headphones still grew, and it was only now that it began to become something more than static. A voice, one of a stern, middle aged woman, talking quietly, hiding under the static. The voice of Jane Reynolds. He ran over to the headset and put it back on, listening very carefully and not making any noise at all.');
		message.channel.send('“We are not destroyed, we will prevail,” she spoke, still cowering under the static, speaking loud enough so that only a man who sat listening in total silence could hear her, “We will reunite at Vechnost in the Bunkerside Bar at midnight tomorrow.” The radio became totally static once more, that was it. He knew the voice, he knew it was her, but he didn’t know whether to trust it. It could be another trap set up by the Republic, or perhaps his mind just playing tricks on him. Then again, what other hope did he have? He had sent the girl with Captain Reynolds, so if he were to ever see her again, this would be it, and he was wanted dead, posters with money on his head flying as far as Maine and Rhode Island. There was nowhere else for him to run but backwards, back into a war he had already lost. He sighed and took off the headphones once more, walking away from the table and towards the exit, staring out into the clouded day that awaited him. Vechnost was only a few miles to the south, a Republic controlled town, but the adventurer had never been there, whatever awaited him there was a mystery to him. He could make it out from where he stood, a large town, almost like Seditionem Ventum, but made out of rusted steel and wood instead of the cleaner steel used in the richer areas. It lit up the forest, even on the cloudy day, and there were tiny specks moving about like ants. People. He leaned on the building, his head down, facing the dirt and rubble below him.');
		message.channel.send('What other choice did he have? The only chance he had was in that town to the south, the only chance he had to keep living. Where else would he go? He sighed deeply and put his hand in his head, confused. If he stayed here he would be rat food within the week, if he went back to Seditionem Ventum he’d be shot on sight, the only choice he had was to accept Reynolds’ call one last time, to start again the war he had already ended. He stood up, taking his hand away from his face, and began to walk into the forest, towards the city. The path down the hill was much easier than the one up it, the way he walked was clear of stones and sticks, and he was no longer half unconscious.');
		message.channel.send('He had been walking for at least two hours when he finally saw the city in a parting between the trees. There was a bridge leading to the city, made over a man made trench that must have been used to defend it. The bridge was wooden, creaking as the wind blew through it, the planks being patched together roughly; one would doubtlessly get countless cuts on his feet if he were to walk over it without shoes. It was sunset now, and there were very few soldiers guarding the gate, and most of them seemed to be occupied with their own business: either speaking with each other or leaning against the wall, their heads facing the ground. The adventurer put the gas mask on, his hood up and began to walk over the bridge. As soon as he set foot on it, two spotlights hit him.');
		message.channel.send('“Who are you and what’s your business!?” one of the guards aiming the spotlight shouted.');
		message.channel.send('“I’m just coming for a safe place to stay the night,” the adventurer said, trying to keep his identity hidden.');
		message.channel.send('One of the guards walked up towards him and scanned him over, aiming the barrel of his rifle at his head. He gestured back towards the other soldiers he was with, a group of at least six, “Looks clear to me,” he said, with a voice that sounded like he had smoked one too many cigars. The spotlights came off of him and the guard returned to his post, opening the gate as he did so. He was in already, something he thought would be impossible to achieve. He began to walk towards the bar, the city seemed almost abandoned, the lights were still on, but very few people walked along the streets now, only a few soldiers, and a couple normal citizens, all with their heads towards the ground, walking towards home and keeping to themselves. The adventurer seemed to be the only civilian with his head up in the entire city, but even so his head was still hidden by the immense shadow cast by his hood. The city seemed to be built off the forest, with houses hanging from trees and being built in their roots, bridges connecting tree to tree, with a little dirt road in the middle of the city, connecting it all together. Some houses seemed like they couldn’t even be entered from the ground, but one would instead have to find his way through the maze above. The place he looked for was not in the trees however, it was a restaurant, buried into the side of an old bunker from before the war. The bunker was ancient, made of stone and concrete, buried into the side of an old hill, with a giant electric sign pointing down to it, “The Bunkerside”.');
		message.channel.send('There were stories about the place, ones that spoke of a plan for a rebellion led by the man who owned the bar, for Vechnost to be the sixth settlement of the Western Rebellion, led by the owner himself, Cade Wescott, and other legends that told that the owner listened in on conversations that the patrons of the bar had, and anyone that spoke about something the Republic didn’t like was taken off to the side and killed, or some just shot straight up inside if whatever they were talking about seemed too rebellious. Knowing the legends that travelled around in the ruins, especially during times of war like this, he didn’t really know which one was more believable. He rather think the first story, about the bartender who helped the Rebellion, but he knew it was more likely the other one was true. It did explain how he had gotten all of his money, especially with taxes as high as they are in the Republic, but who knows? Maybe he just got good business, Vechnost was one of the most prominent places in the Republic.');
		message.channel.send('The bunker, unlike the rest of the city, was filled to the brim with people. Some simply stood around, leaning on the outside wall or hanging off the balcony, most holding empty bottles of beer or vodka in their hands, quickly drinking whatever hadn’t already been drunk, and gulping up air from the empty bottles. He slipped through them, into the crowded building itself. The room was in good condition, and it seemed somewhat orderly, most people sitting at tables and simply chatting among themselves, probably not because of general politeness, but because of fear of the two guards that stood at the gate. He didn’t know what he would pay with, he had nothing, no bullets, nothing of worth, none of the Republic’s paper currency. He looked around, trying to find someone from the Rebellion he recognized, but there was no one, and everyone seemed to be staring at him: the creepy man, shadowed by a dark hood and a gas mask. Some men were too engaged in conversation to notice him, others were simply too drunk to care, some even too drunk to look up and see him. The room began to ease it’s voice, almost to silence, almost all the eyes on the adventurer, who simply stood there, trying to find someone he knew. But there was still no one. Maybe he was lied to? Maybe it was just another trap, and he was the only one idiotic enough to fall for it? Everyone in the room was a stranger to him, no one trying to hide themselves like he was, the room was filled simply with old, drunken, white haired men, portly and fat, who sat, leaning back calmly in their chairs, their curious eyes gazing upon him. But there were others, younger people, some even seemingly younger than Carla, who sat with red eyes and cheeks, sitting with their heads on the table, only lifting them up to let the alcohol soothe them, and some others whose emotions were purely drowned out by the alcohol itself, bursting out with drunken laughter.');
		message.channel.send('The adventurer walked from table to table, no longer trying to find those he searched for, but now instead simply trying to find some space to sit. He had no money, nothing with which to pay, perhaps maybe the coat or the gas mask, but this was no trading market, it was a bar: they probably only took the simpler things: bullets, ammo, anything of that sort. Plus, how much of an idiot would he look like if he walked up to a bartender and asked, “How many shots will this coat buy me?” Then again, idiots among this crowd had probably asked to pay with more moronic things. The people sitting at the tables often glanced up at him, trying to see his face under the shadow cast by the hood, while other people simply whispered and pointed up at him. He took no notice to it, he could hardly care what these people thought of him, how they pointed at him in awe, in wonder, or simply in fear. He hated being feared, especially by those he worked to help, to protect, but it was good to be a man who was feared during the war. There was a table in the far back corner, a small round one with five seats, and the adventurer took the one closest to the corner itself and sat, taking off his plastic gas mask and placing it on the table, putting his head into his hands, thinking, letting the mesmerizing noise of the drunken crowd send him to sleep.');
		message.channel.send('The adventurer’s eyes blinked as he woke up, still laying on the table, his head facing towards the bar. The tables were no longer filled and merry, instead now only a small, slow moving crowd remained, mostly consisting of men to drunk to stand, who simply made the bar their home for the night. How long had he been sleeping in that depressing little corner? Two, three hours? Maybe four? It felt like it had been ages, years even, but it was times like this when his mind tended to play tricks on him. Most of the sane people still in the place all seemed to be gathered around some other table, off towards the middle of the room, at a small round table, surrounded by figures like himself. He stood up slowly from the table, pushing his chair in behind him as he lazily walked towards the group.');
		message.channel.send('“Excuse me,” he said, approaching them, as one of them turned to face him, and the others looked up at him, but he was cut off before he could finish his question.');
		message.channel.send('“Adrian Bauer?” one of them in the back asked, a voice he did not recognize, one of a man, somewhat young though clearly an adult.');
		message.channel.send('“Yes.”');
		message.channel.send('“Sit down,” the same voice commanded him.');
		message.channel.send('He took the one remaining chair and sat in it, looking at all the people that surrounded him, who all appeared to be staring at him, or at least as far as he could tell, as all their faces were hidden under their overcasting hoods.');
		message.channel.send('“Hoc est somnium,” one of the figures said, speaking their Latin quickly in a quiet female voice.');
		message.channel.send('“What?”');
		message.channel.send('“Hoc est somnium,” the same figure and the one who greeted him both said, now.');
		message.channel.send('“Ego iracundiam provocans est, the adventurer spoke the code phrase of the Rebellion, the Latin words for “I am rebellious”.');
		message.channel.send('“Hoc est somnium,” the two figures said again, now joined by the two next to them, both of whom had female voices, one very young and one somewhat old.');
		message.channel.send('“What are you saying!?”');
		message.channel.send('“Hoc est somnium,” the final figure, the one seated at the middle of the table, directly facing the adventurer spoke, his voice with a heavy, deep, metallic voice.');
		message.channel.send('“Cassius Devitt, this is just another trap, isn’t it?” the adventurer spat out as the man across him lowered his hood and lifted his head, revealing not a face, but the bleach white mask of a nightmarish plague doctor. The other four hooded figures raised their heads and removed their hoods, two of them were normal men he did not know, the other two were Jane Reynolds and Carla herself. What were they doing here? Was this just a trap, were they nothing more than traitors?');
		message.channel.send('“Carla, Jane!” he yelled at them, trying to get their attention, but they did not so much as move, not even blink. Perhaps they were just stuffed corpses propped up on chairs, but didn’t matter anymore, he was a dead man. The Doctor took a pistol out of his pocket, pushing his chair back as he rose from it, pointing it at the adventurer. That was it, he was dead, there was nothing else he could do. There wasn’t any escape now, no fiendish way to escape out, he was cornered like rabbit cornered by a rabid dog. Time seemed to slow as he went through the last few thoughts of his life, closing his eyes and bowing his head, but when the shot rang through the halls, the adventurer’s thoughts still carried on. He blinked his eyes open and looked back up. Cassius Devitt still stood straight across from him, but his pistol was no longer in his hand, instead it was laid on the table, the barrel of it still smoking. The four figures were no longer in their seats, they lied dead on the ground, each with holes straight through their heads, showing the floor behind them and leaking red ooze. All in a flash, Carla, Jane, gone. Within a week his leg, his home, his commander, Carla, Reynolds, the entire Western Rebellion, all shot dead and gone, burned to the ground and buried six feet under or just eaten by birds, never to return.');
		message.channel.send('“Hoc est somnium,” the Doctor said, returning to his seat, taking a bottle from the table and pouring dark brown liquid from it into his cup, “You speak Latin, do you not?”');
		message.channel.send('“Some.”');
		message.channel.send('“Yet you don’t know ‘hoc est somnium’? How sad, it is nothing more than a simple phrase. Deus vult, ad victoriam, I presume you know these?”');

		message.channel.send('“Latin is quite a fine language. You know I do speak it fluently, but I-”');
		message.channel.send('“What do you want from me, Cassius?” Adrian interrupted him as he spoke, hoping to sway the conversation back to something more logical.');
		message.channel.send('“My my, Adrian Bauer, I was trying to be polite! How many years has it been since we’ve had a decent conversation!”');
		message.channel.send('The adventurer, not being a man to keep track of time, did not respond, for he did not know.');
		message.channel.send('“Eleven years, in the Great Calendar of the Republic, since you fled the Constanti Academy. You know you never did tell me why you left?”');
		message.channel.send('“I was tired of seeing the hangings, the shootings, the towns burning to the ground, I couldn’t live with it. They taught me to murder innocents, not defend the Republic.”');
		message.channel.send('“Each man is innocent in their own hearts, or in the heart of another, we simply taught you to kill those in the way of the path of the Republic without mercy.”');
		message.channel.send('“Children and old men stand in your path?”');

		message.channel.send('“That day, the day you sent me to burn Remeny with the others, you stood behind me, still with that mask of yours on, thrusted a gun into my hands, and told me to shoot anyone and everyone.

Failures in the eyes of the Republic, that is.”');
		message.channel.send('“If they weren’t able to take out someone like that quickly enough, they’d all be shot and killed by ones that could defend themselves.”');

		message.channel.send('“Mr. Bauer, do you know how I became Head Doctor of the Republic?”');
		message.channel.send('“Do I care?”');
		message.channel.send('“When I was five years old, I was diagnosed with- well, you wouldn’t understand, but it caused me to be unable to breathe normally, and I was told I was to wear a respirator for the rest of my life, during all activities besides eating. I wore that same mask for six years, until my father sent me to the Constanti Academy. They found that the… intense training… was too much for it to handle, so they put a different one on me, similar to the one I have now,” the Doctor gestured towards the small box on his chest, protected by armor and plating, “That new one, while it did help, still didn’t allow for intense combat or anything of that sort. So they decided to relocate me to the doctorate facility, where they trained me in basic medical fields. They wanted me to be a nurse, but I wanted more. I began putting bits and pieces together, taking off robotic pieces from the old, rusted microscopes no one used anymore. When I was fourteen, I was working with a patient in the medical hall, a soldier who had, by chance, lost his finger. I was supposed to be simply patching it up, covering it with medical tape or, hell, even a band-aid. But I knew more could be done. I took those scraps out of my pocket and I started to put them to use. I won’t go into detail, but let’s just say that the man woke back up with five fingers again. My overseer, I forget his name, was astounded, taking an immediate interest in my skills and sending me to his superiors. And what did they do? They took a few people from the streets, cut there fingers and sometimes even their whole hand off, and they just threw them at me and told me to make it work again.');
		message.channel.send('Every single one succeeded, though I do admit some patients were not happy with the results, I did the best I could. This goes on for another year, before they finally find me good enough to meet the Head Doctor of the Republic himself, Dr. Luther Curtis. He was astounded at my skill, but he told me he wanted to see it really work, on the field: the Burning of Veba, the home of the Cult of the Plague. We walked behind the rows and rows of soldiers, equipped with only a pistol and a knife, as the whole city went up in flames. Soldiers fell left and right, and I did my best to piece them back together, though some went back up more so monstrosity than man, all screaming in agony from the painful procedures, or simply from the effects of it. The smoke from the flames took it’s toll on my lungs, but I still managed to push through to the very last man. When those who remained of our troops, almost a third of them with my robotic limbs and alterations, came at last to the throne of the “Great Plague Doctor”, a title the cultist had given himself,  we had our two biggest men grab him by the arms and hold him right in front of Dr. Curtis and I. And what does he do? He rips the mask right off his face, lifts up his pistol, and shoots him in the head, right between the eyes, and the two soldiers just let go of him and let him drop to the ground. And the head doctor just looks at me and hands me the mask, telling me that I’ve earned it and should wear it with pride. When he died two years later, he gave the title of Head Doctor to me, a seventeen year old, the youngest that had ever been given that title, and I haven’t removed this mask for anything aside from eating in eighteen years.”');
		message.channel.send('“And what was the point in telling me all that?”');
		message.channel.send('“To tell you that I’ve earned my place in the Republic. You? You haven’t earned the lenses in your gas mask, nor the dust on your jacket.”');
		message.channel.send('“You think slaughtering innocents brings you glory, makes you deserve your place?”');
		message.channel.send('“I am a medical genius, Mr. Bauer, and you have done nothing but work against progress,” the Doctor picked the pistol back up and aimed it up at him, “To be fair, you haven’t even earned the bullets in the chamber, but I’m feeling generous today.” He aimed the gun up at the head of the adventurer and pulled the trigger, and this time his thoughts did end and his world did fade to black.');
		message.channel.send('He woke up yet again, still sitting in that same table, slouched over and lying on it. So that was it? That whole story was nothing more than another dream confusing his mind. How did he know all that stuff about Cassius? He had probably been told it ages ago, when he was still being taught under his wing, back at the Constanti Academy, so many years ago. The dream seemed to tell truth, but how could one trust a dream? He remembered hearing about the Battle of Veba, he was only nine when it had happened, at that point he and his parents had only been in the Republic for a year, maybe even less. The tales they told of the battle over the radio were epic, those of great courage and strength on the side of the Republic, but they told nothing about the dozens of innocents and civilians doubtlessly slaughtered. He was admitted into the Constanti Academy two years later, at the age of eleven, hoping to be a hero like the soldiers that had taken Veba before him. There, at the academy, he was taught by countless men, all of which he wished he could put a bullet into now for teaching him nothing but how to shoot an innocent man, the only teacher of these he remembered was Cassius Devitt, a teacher who had a great respect for Adrian himself. Devitt was the man who taught him how to shoot a gun, how to patch up wounds, something usually left for the old men who used to be soldiers. He put up with it all for three years, until the Burning of Remeny, when he had finally had enough of it all. Not even a week later, he took his few belongings he had, and returned to his mother and father in New Arkney, and stayed there until it all began: the Great Imperial War, as it was called in the Republic.');
		message.channel.send('He knew all of that, but how was his mind able to piece together it all, mixed in with the strange things that laid forgotten in the back of his mind. But what did the past matter now? He began to lift his head up, looking around him. Unlike the dream, the bar was still buzzing with business, countless men, some drunk, some depressed, stumbling from table to table with bottles or jugs of their favorite poison. There was a little kid walking around, wearing a hood that shadowed her face, casting a long shadow down to the floor behind her. She looked over towards the adventurer, and glanced at him sideways. Could it have been Carla? Before he could even take notice of the little girl, she darted back into the crowd of drunken men, their mile-long shadows overcasting her and her shadow. No, it wasn’t Carla, she was probably already dead, but he didn’t care, he still wanted something to fight for.');
		message.channel.send('Another hooded figure came out of the crowd and pondered at the sight of the adventurer. He could see the little girl pulling at the sleeve of the older one, and he stared right back at them. Clearly they noticed this, at the little girl cowered in fright and hid against the side of the older one. The adventurer shook his head and took his book out of his pocket, taking out his pen and beginning to write.');
		message.channel.send('“My nightmares haunt me, following me around everywhere. I can no longer sleep without one of them appearing, and they all seem to get more detailed each time. I can no longer tell what is reality and what is dream. Perhaps soon I’ll wake up yet again, and this book will be as empty as it was when I woke up moments ago. Nothing makes sense anymore. But then again, has anything made sense in the past seven years?” he didn’t get far into writing before he noticed the little girl, no longer cowering before whom he presumed to be her mother, pointing at the book he was writing in. The mother, seeing the adventurer glaring at them, tried to lower the girl’s arm, but she refused. They spoke something to each other, but he couldn’t tell what it was over the loud blabbing of the drunken crowd, but from what he could see of their movements it was clear the mother was reprimanding the girl. Much to his surprise, and doubtlessly the surprise of the mother, the girl ripped her hand away from her mother and ran towards the adventurer’s table, jumping over to him and standing next to him.');

		message.channel.send('“Adrian?” the girl spoke, he recognized the voice clearly as Carla’s.');
		message.channel.send('“Carla? How did you-”');
		message.channel.send('“Mr. Bauer, of all the men I thought would have escaped. You come back for one last strike at the Republic?” the mother spoke, standing next to the child. The voice was old and rugged, one that had seen countless wars and battles. It was the voice of Captain Jane Reynolds.');
		message.channel.send('“How are you alive?” the adventurer asked, watching as the captain took a seat next to him and put a small glass bottle on the table, as the girl stood between their chairs.');
		message.channel.send('“Luck. Luck and hope.”');
		message.channel.send('“And speed. And bullets,” Carla chimed in a more realistic approach to Reynolds’ positive answer.');
		message.channel.send('“Has anyone else come?”');
		message.channel.send('“No.”');
		message.channel.send('“Then how are we going to-” the adventurer was cut short by a large, portly man, stepping through the crowd with a large revolver in hand. He was coming for the three of them, but why? They had done nothing wrong nor broken any rules, but so much as speaking was most likely against Republic laws here. Or maybe he had overheard them speaking, talking about rebellion and their true origins, the most wanted criminals in the entire Republic. The owner stepped up and stood at the far side of the table, facing the three of them. ');
		message.channel.send('“Excuse me you three,” he spoke in a deep, authoritative voice, “I apologize for my rudeness, but I’m going to have to ask you to leave.”');
		message.channel.send('“Why?” the adventurer lifted his head up and looked the bartender dead in the eyes, though the bartender himself could not see Adrian’s eyes, “We weren’t doing anything-”');
		message.channel.send('“I have my reasons. Get out,” the owner said sternly, spinning the clip of his revolver in his hand.');
		message.channel.send('“No,” the adventurer said sternly.');
		message.channel.send('“Adrian!” Captain Reynolds spoke under her breath, only loud enough for the adventurer and possibly Carla to hear.');
		message.channel.send('“Listen, I don’t wanna make a mess of you three. Just get out of my bar before I have to-”');		
		message.channel.send('“You wouldn’t shoot us. It’s bad for business,” the adventurer interrupted. He had no idea what he was doing, he knew his acts were foolish, but he wasn’t simply going to leave because he seemed a bit suspicious. The old bartender lifted up the pistol and aimed it straight at Adrian’s head.');
		message.channel.send('“Wanna bet?”');
		message.channel.send('The adventurer stood up from his chair and walked up to the bartender, his hand close to his pocket where he held his knife, the little girl and the captain both sitting there watching. “How much?”');
		message.channel.send('The bartender took his pistol and aimed it at the bottle and shot it. Glass erupted everywhere, and liquid oozed out of where the bottle had been. “Four bullets and a glass of whatever the hell that was,” the bartender taunted Adrian and his company, aiming the gun straight up towards the the adventurer’s chest. The adventurer pushed the gun away from his chest, holding it by the barrel, and the bartender shot it, but it hit nothing but the ceiling. The entire bar was staring at them now, some had started to run away, fearing for the worst. The adventurer stomped on the owner’s foot with his own heavy, robotic one, and he cried out in pain, letting go of his gun. He kicked the bartender right in the knee, making a loud cracking noise that doubtlessly meant it had been shattered, and he stumbled to the ground in pain, clenching at his knee, trying to come to his senses, but there was too much pain. The adventurer looked around, the entire bar was empty now, and his two companions were huddling behind the table, trembling with fear. He took the gun and aimed it down at the bartender, and shot him without uttering a word from his mouth, throwing the gun to the ground after he did so. There were people rambling about outside, doubtlessly talking about whatever had happened inside. Loud metallic footsteps went through the city; somebody had told the guards, or perhaps they had just heard the shot.');
		message.channel.send('“Hide, quick! They’ll only kill me if they don’t find you,” the adventurer whisper shouted at the two of them.');
		message.channel.send('“No,” the captain stood out from behind the table, clenching the hand of the little girl who still stood behind her, shaking, “I’ve had enough of this.”');
		message.channel.send('“What!?”');
		message.channel.send('“Running. Hiding. This whole rebellion. I lost count of the number of lives I’ve ended the day the war began. It’s probably somewhere in the thousands by now. I’m done. I’ve killed all the men I will.”');
		message.channel.send('“But-”');
		message.channel.send('“What I say is final. So unless you want us both to die, you should leave,” she said as she let go of Carla’s hand. As much as the adventurer hated to let her die, he knew that she couldn’t be persuaded. He looked at her face one last time: there was a single tear sliding down her face, and she took off her hood, turning around to face the entrance. He grabbed Carla by the shoulders and dragged her to the side, behind the bar itself, knocking over a few chairs and tables as they made their way there. The metallic footsteps could be heard against the concrete floor of the bunker, three pairs of them. They drew closer and closer, then finally drew to a close. Neither Adrian nor his little companion could see the events that were unfolding, but it was easy enough to hear them.');
		message.channel.send('“You there! Who the hell do you think you are?” one of the guards spoke. There was a sound of the butt end of a gun smacking against something, and the rebounding sound of pain, and a loud cracking noise. He looked down, and the girl was curled up in a ball besides him, her hands covering her ears. He patted her on the head, comforting her, but it was of no use. What right did he have to comfort her, anyway? It was his fault this was all happening, he may as well try to make amends for it. The sound of the soldier’s guns shuffling about was loud, quite noticeable above the near total silence in the bar. Something hit the ground with a loud thud, probably Reynolds, crumpling to the ground in pain. He hated to listen to it, and he, like the little girl, covered his ears and laid against the hard, concrete floor, waiting for time to pass. The speaking continued, but he couldn’t decipher the words they spoke, it sounded like nothing more than distant mumbling, three voices of strong, valiant men, one of a frail, broken, old woman. The girl was still shaking, and as he took his hands away from his ears, he could hear her faintly sobbing. There was no longer any talking, only sounds of pain and the sounds of bones cracking and breaking, and he, out of curiosity, looked out from behind the bar to see what was going on. Jane Reynolds lay on the floor, her body almost motionless, with three soldiers standing behind her, hitting her and kicking her with anything they could find. He watched for at least five minutes, and still it went on, and still she lived. He could no longer take it, his entire mind being overtaken with hatred and rage, forgetting all logic and neglecting all the consequences for anyone besides himself. He hated them so much, they had taken away all the hope left to him in the world, and he would not let them go unpunished.');
		message.channel.send('“Stay here,” the adventurer warned the girl, who no longer hid her ears with her hands, but instead hid her crying face with them, and she merely nodded in response. Adrian jumped out from behind the table, screaming at the top of his lungs. No English or any other language could be deciphered from his screaming, it was merely inhuman savagery. One of the soldiers aimed their gun at him and started yelling at him, but before he could fire, the adventurer took his knife out of the holster in his pocket, gripping it’s sharp end in his hand, and threw it, smacking the soldier right through the chest, leaving a growing red splash on his clothes as he fell to the ground. The other two soldiers took out their guns and began to fire at him, but he was too quick to be shot by their simple pistols. He ran up to the first one, holding his gun by the barrel, pointing it upwards, then pushed him backwards with all his force into the other soldier, taking the gun and knocking them both to the ground. He took the gun and fired it at one’s head, the blood exploding out and spraying onto the other soldier. He shot the hand of the other soldier so he couldn’t use his gun, ran up to him, and stomped on his face with his metallic foot, leaving it so deformed one would not be able to identify the man’s corpse to whomever he had been before.

Her head looked as though she had been beaten in the head with a metal bat. Her eyes were closed, and she merely looked up at the ceiling. He knelt down next to her, trying to avoid the pool of blood, but some of it still soaked his knee, drenching them in blood and the foul odor of death.');

		message.channel.send('He sighed deeply, his body no longer being able to muster tears, it hadn’t been able to in years, but he knew well that he would if he could. He glanced over her corpse, looking for anything that the Republic should know about. Her golden necklace was still wrapped around her neck, slightly stained red and brown from blood and mud. It was disrespectful to loot the dead, he of all people knew that, but he knew if he didn’t, some moronic drunk man would take it, or it would just be burned when whoever the co owner of the bar was took over and threw her corpse into the furnace out back the next day. He took the necklace out from around her neck and held it out in front of him. There was a small locket at the end of it, made of the same material as the rest of it, but with special welded details. He opened it, and it gave him no trouble as he did so. Inside was a picture of a man, clearly some religious figure. God maybe? Allah? Jesus? He didn’t know, he had never been religious, he knew there was something up there, watching over, but he didn’t study, believe, or care for anything more than that. He thought that Jane had shared the same opinion as him, but it seemed not, unless this man was someone else he simply didn’t know. It didn’t matter, it was something to remember her by, and it was obvious now that that necklace would last longer than the flames of their rebellion.');
		message.channel.send('He stood up and walked over to the corpse of one of the soldiers, pulling his knife out of his chest. He walked over to his table where he had sat before the massacre had begun. He picked up the book, there was a small blood stain on the top corner, but it didn’t hide or blur any of what he had written. He took it and the pen and put it into his pocket, walking back over to the girl. ');
