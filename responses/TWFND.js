		message.channel.send('A distant humming filled the empty streets of the old, abandoned city, singing an old tune from hundreds of years before. The deep footsteps in thick, heavy snow made a soft thud that echoed across the otherwise silent, lifeless streets, rebounding from window to window. A bright light came from the hand of the man who made these noises, coming from an old, rusty flashlight, tightly strapped to his revolver, which made a small path through the seemingly infinite black ink of darkness, lighting up whatever lied in front of it. The man was hardly visible in the overcasting shadow of night; the only noticeable features being his tall, muscular build, and his menacing cape, which dangled down to the ground, sliding slowly across the snow, alongside a large, dark hood, that hid anything   that could have been seen on his face, even in the darkness. He looked like an adventurer, an explorer, someone who was searching for some unknown treasure he desired, but it was very clear that, if one could see the mans face under his secretive hood and the shroud of darkness, he had a destination in mind. He didn’t have the look of a mercenary, though he wore similar clothing. The look in his eyes proved otherwise: he was set on something, a goal, a mission, a destiny, and to him, there was no wall he couldn’t climb that would stop him from reaching that destiny.');
	  	message.channel.send('He walked into an old subway station, the walls rusted by time, yellowed and dusty, falling apart and peeling. One of the walls had crumbled down, leaving nothing but the metal supports and the frame behind it, of which had rusted, some of it collapsed. The station was fragile, it had seen countless years and countless battles. There was a massive door blocking his entry to the station, it’s metal somewhat clean and well kept, unlike the rest of the station, and it was tied together by a mix of bolts, screws, and tape. On the middle there was a large insignia: a red rectangle with three white swords; the flag of the Republic. It appeared crude, but it served it’s purpose. He put his gun quickly into his holster, turning off its flashlight, then raised his hand and pounded it on the door.');
    		message.channel.send('The door began to creak, dust and frosted snow coming out of it as the gate opened. The lights inside were almost blinding compared to the darkness that remained outside the station, and the shadow of a man, clearly a guard of the station, was cast down on the adventurer, openly pointing his double-barrel shotgun at him.');
    		message.channel.send('"What are you doin’ here, old man?" the guard said in a very serious manner, speaking in a voice so deep it almost seemed fake, almost as though he was trying to assert dominance over the adventurer.');
    		message.channel.send('"I am on official business with the Aeternum Republic, here to see Doctor Cassius Devitt," the man replied swiftly and sharply.');
    		message.channel.send('"The Plague Doctor? What for? Who sent you?" the guard responded with anger, believing the adventurer was nothing more than a fake and a liar. He responded with nothing, instead pulling a small piece of paper out of his pocket, gesturing it towards the guard. He took it fiercely with one hand, keeping the other on the shotgun pointed at the man, acting as though he were about to rip the sheet in half. The guard stared at the paper for a moment, then looked up from the paper directly at the adventurer, then back down at the paper. He growled angrily, clearly showing his teeth, and frowned at the man.');
    		message.channel.send('“Authority to see the Doctor from the Executor himself… fine. Come with me,” the guard handed the adventurer back his paper, who then proceeded to put it back into his pocket. The guard held his shotgun at his side and began to walk the man through the station.');
    		message.channel.send('“You’re the first man to come see him in a while. He might not be so… sociable,” the guard explained to him, looking forward, keeping his eyes off the adventurer out of hatred, possibly even out of fear.');
    		message.channel.send('“I’ve dealt with worse.”');
    		message.channel.send('“If you don’t mind me asking, what business do are you here to see him about?”');
    		message.channel.send('“I do mind you asking.”');
    		message.channel.send('People were somewhat scarce at the station, most appeared to only be passing through, coming onto the platform itself to make their way into the tunnel on the opposite side, or to trade with one of the very few salesmen who made a living off of the trade there. There was one of these that caught the adventurer’s eye for a moment: a man standing behind one of these market stands, middle aged and in a bad state of health, with a large scar coming down from the top of his forehead all the way to the top of his lip, completely covering one eye and rendering it useless. Two guards appeared in front of his stand suddenly, both with large guns drawn. They began screaming at the old man, but the old man almost completely ignored them.');
    		message.channel.send('“…if you don’t pay up right now… we have orders on the behalf of the Republic to seize tax…” the guards shouted at him. Much to their surprise, the old man came back with just the same force, but his was not shown in words. Instead, he reached under his cabinet for something. The guards most likely thought it was the money he had to pay, but the old man would much rather die than let the guards take from him again.');
    		message.channel.send('Like a quick flash of light, he whipped out a pistol and killed one of the guards in front of him, square in between the eyes. A good shot for a man his age. He took the gun and pointed it at the other and pulled the trigger. An empty click. The remaining guard simply laughed at the old man, and raised his gun at him. The adventurer turned away quickly, as in spite of all the things he had seen, he still couldn’t stand to see a poor old man suffer such a fate as this. The gunshot thundered across the station, echoing across it’s aging halls and into the tunnels.');
    		message.channel.send('The adventurer clenched his fist in anger, wishing he could reach for his pistol and do just as the old man had done, but he knew that there was no way he would be able to get out alive if he did something as stupid as that. Then again, he was about to meet Cassius face to face, for the first time in years, how would he survive something like that? The man could only vaguely remember his first time meeting the doctor, thinking only of the menacing plague doctor helmet that he had so ingeniously made into a respirator.');
		message.channel.send('How many years ago had that been? Three? It had been fourteen years since he had fled the Constanti Academy, but he didn’t count that as meeting him. Both the adventurer himself and the crazed doctor had changed too much for events that long ago to matter anymore. Had it been three years? Only three? It had felt like an eternity, but to him time had become beyond comprehension. It was hard to keep track of time during the war, and events sped past him, running away into the deep pits of his mind, hiding behind old, fragmented memories, torn apart by time. Whenever the adventurer tried to think too hard, to remember what Cassius looked like or sounded like, the memory completely vanished, the only thing left behind being his sinister laugh, made metallic by the thick gas he wore. ');
		message.channel.send('He rolled up the sleeve of his coat briefly on his right arm and looked at his wrist. The numbers still remained: 7935, and though the burned mark had been heavily decayed with time, it was still easily readable. The numbers didn’t mean that he was the 7935th to go through with the procedure, only that he was the 7935th one to go into the doctor’s “care”. Care meant almost anything to Cassius, from replacing a limb with a robotic one, to disassembling someone simply to study them; to see how they worked.');
		message.channel.send('How did he even manage to escape that hellish place? The adventurer shook his head quickly, as to force the ideas out of his mind. The pains he withheld during those five hours were the worst of his life, and the tears that were ripped open healed only to scars, of which could never be truly fixed. Five hours of hell left a mark on his mind that endless years of peace would never be able restore. It wasn’t like that mattered, though: peace would never come for him, and he knew that and had accepted it long ago.');
		message.channel.send('The adventurer and his escort arrived at the end of the hall, at a large, rusted metal door, with no windows or possible ways of seeing out. Two white robed guards with black masks stood at each side of the door, each holding a similarly painted shotgun, aimed towards the ground, held in both hands. They looked much more formal and professional than the scrapped-armor covered soldiers that roamed the streets. The guards raised their guns silently towards the adventurer and his escort.');
		message.channel.send('“At ease!” his escort put his hand up, signaling the guards to lower their weapons, though they did not, “He’s here to see Cassius, he has orders, from the Executor.” He gestured for the adventurer to give them the sheet of paper he held, and he did so. The left hand guard walked up and snatched it out of his hand, staring at it with eyes that couldn’t be seen behind the immense, black mask. The guard nodded, putting the paper in his pocket, and opened the door, letting the adventurer through without a word.');
		message.channel.send('The room that stood before him was black and empty, even darker than the night that awaited him outside the station. Soon, the bright light from behind him began to dissipate: someone had closed the door. The door gave a loud thud as it finally shut, trapping the adventurer inside with the doctor. The adventurer removed his hood and took out his revolver.');
		message.channel.send('“Cassius, old friend, it has been a while hasn’t it?” he said, looking around the room, hoping to see something out of the darkness. A deep, heavy, metallic breathing began to come from what appeared to be the back of the room. A small light appeared behind the place where the breathing was coming from, illuminating a tall, menacing figure. A deep and heavy laugh followed, a laugh that had haunted the dreams- well, nightmares- of the adventurer for years.');
		message.channel.send('“Adrian Bauer? Your courage inspires me, yet your idiocracy makes me cringe,” the doctor said, at last revealing his metallic voice to the adventurer, “You could have been quite a fine soldier, you know? All I needed to do was make a handful of… adjustments.”');
		message.channel.send('“Torture and partial brain removal? You’re a sociopath,” Adrian spoke calmly, yet his shaking arms and sweating palms said otherwise. Cassius simply sighed, letting loose an almost robotic exhale.');
		message.channel.send('“The shadow of what could have been haunts over me still, you know. I’ve tried to forget the name, truthfully. Adrian Bauer. He died as he left the Constanti Academy. All you could have been, gone and dead. Quite a shame.”');
		message.channel.send('“I don’t regret any of it.”');
		message.channel.send('“Really? Not even after what happened to Anna?”');
		message.channel.send('“If I hadn’t left, you would have made me murder her with my own hands,” Adrian clenched his fist tighter, the bringing up of his mother, especially her death, brought upon him nothing but hatred for the man he spoke with.');
		message.channel.send('“Perhaps, but a good, loyal soldier would be willing to do such a thing. And I assure you, I could have made you loyal. Perhaps I still can?” the Doctor said, laughing again as he tapped a button he held in his hand, and a set of bright lights turned on, one in each corner of the hellish laboratory. However, the adventurer wished the lights could remain off: the sights would be enough to haunt him for the rest of his days.');
		message.channel.send('The walls were plain white, in somewhat good condition,aside from the immense stains of blood. Scratch marks from desperate “patients” drained of all hope, with nothing more than the wish to escape, but well knowing that that wish would never come true. The more the adventurer looked around the room, the more he realized that the blood had almost left no surface untouched. In the middle of the room stood an operating table, with a man, presumably dead, lying with his back up on it. The patient wore pants and shoes, but he did not have his shirt on, instead his back was laid open, with a massive scar climbing across it, cutting in so deep that it revealed his spine. There were numerous wires and cables connected to the spine, as well as metal braces that connected the spine to these wires. The man’s head was shaved bald, with the left half of his head cut open, revealing his brain, with another large brace connecting the patient’s mind to another set of wires. All the wires, both from the spine and the brain, connected to a small battery, no larger than a man’s hand and no heavier than maybe a dozen pounds, which was attached to the patient’s leg. A small piece of a cloth tarp covered the right arm of the poor man, and numerous wires from the battery, spine, and brain went under the tarp to his hand.');
		message.channel.send('The adventurer couldn’t take his eyes off the patient, not because of awe, but because of dread and a deep feeling of utter hopelessness. Despite this, he tightened his grip on his revolver and prepared to shoot. The Doctor stood behind the table where he worked on his cyborg menace, and he was just as the adventurer remembered him: a tall figure, wearing a pitch black set of bulletproof armor and blood stained, white doctor gloves, and his face was completely hidden by a spotlessly white plague doctor’s mask, with a number of tubes coming out of it, onto a small respirator near his chest, which was, like the rest of the doctor, coated in armor. His armor and clothes were stained dark red with the blood of his patients.');
		message.channel.send('“Beautiful isn’t it?” the madman let loose his metallic laugh once more, then looked at the, “I do apologize for the… mess. Had I known you were coming, Mr. Bauer, I would have prepared myself accordingly.” The Doctor glanced briefly at the adventurer’s pistol, then back up at the grim, horrified look on his face. The adventurer was scowling angrily, looking like he was about to tear someone in half, his fists were clenched, one around his revolver, the other around nothing but misty air, yet still he did not shoot the doctor.');
		message.channel.send('“Do not worry, Mr. Brauer, he came willingly. We promised him immortality, a life without fear and pain, in return for only a lifetime of service to the Republic! It sounds like a wonderful offer,” the doctor’s voice was bright and happy, yet still menacing, but it suddenly deepened as he told the man, “We didn’t lie to him, really. We just… didn’t tell him some of the lesser things that might occur after the surgery.”');
		message.channel.send('Adrian watched the doctor closely as he walked towards a wall with a very large scratch mark and ran his hand along it, “Once he heard about the true process of the surgery- transformation I should call it, really. A normal surgery works to fix something, change something. My surgery, my… transformation… works to make one perfect. But I’m getting off track,” Cassius laughed lightly as he continues his story, “Once he had heard about the real process of the transformation, he did his very best in an attempt to escape. We slaughtered his attempt, but,” the Doctor traced his hand across the large scar on the wall once more, “his attempt did come at a cost to us, and to him. His personality was broken, he could never be truly fixed. He could never be the same as he was before the transformation, and I made sure of that. Besides the normal removal of the amygdala, I also removed and damaged a large section, of the frontal lobe- specifically to destroy his personality. He acts like an ape, almost, yet more sophisticated, almost like a mercenary. But you know what I didn’t remove? Hatred. And all I need to do in order to turn enable this hatred,” the Doctor reached into his pocket and pulled out a small device, and flicked a button on it, “is press a button.”');
		message.channel.send('The adventurer backed away from the Doctor and his patient. The patient began to rise slowly, first putting his hand, the one not covered by cloth, onto the bed and pushing himself up. He took his right leg and raised it to stand, then got up into the other, leaving himself to crouch with one hand on the table. He stood up fully, with his back to the adventurer, but slowly turned to face him and jump off the table, standing right in front of him and stared him in the eyes. The eyes of the patient were unblinking, nor did they ever disconnect themselves from the eyes of the adventurer.');
		message.channel.send('“What is this? What have you-”');
		message.channel.send('“A patient, Mr. Bauer. One of my proudest creations, only below Cassia.”');
		message.channel.send('**‘This isn’t a creation, it’s a monstrosity!”**');
		message.channel.send('“A monstrosity, please! Mr. Bauer, I taught you to be a gentlemen, now show the respect you’ve learned!” the Doctor said, laughing as he looked over to Adrian, who simply glared silently, the same look of hatred on his face.');
		message.channel.send('“Now, I am dearly sorry, Mr. Bauer, but I am afraid I won’t be able to let you leave this place. If the Rebellion got word of this, why, the Executor would give me hell!” he laughed again, likely giving some menacing grin from before. Adrian raised his arm to shoot his pistol, but before he could shoot, the patient grabbed him by the neck with his completely robotic left hand, choking and holding him above the ground, his fist like a clamp. In a last attempt for life, he shot his pistol, rapidly and randomly. Six loud bangs, all of which echoed throughout the halls, each of them missing the creation and it’s maker. The adventurer gagged for a breath, hoping to keep consciousness, but to no avail. He felt his head getting heavy, and felt himself collapse as the robotic hand finally let him go. Yet even after he was able to breath, his vision still faded to black.');
		message.channel.send('“Put him with the others,” he could hear the Plague Doctor say as he finally failed himself, and let himself into the darkness of unconsciousness.');
		message.channel.send('Adrian’s eyes opened slowly, blinking rapidly as they did, trying to clear his blurred vision from the blood, sweat, and tears. He was lying in a small, rusted room with a bulky looking metal door. The only light in the room came from it’s small cracks and hinges, giving him just enough light to see the few things closest to the door. He was still in his hooded clothes, however they were ragged and torn, with a large scar protruding through his jeans, showing a massive cut. But how did it get there? It must have happened while he was unconscious. The man shook his head, trying to let his thoughts out of his clotted brain. What was going on? The first thing that came to his mind as soon as he had woken up was pain: a massive scar running along his left calf, his neck still tight, only allowing for an occasional, painful breath.');
		message.channel.send('He slowly tried to stand up, though he was hardly able; with his right leg holding the majority of his weight, leaving everything else to be carried by his left, causing it immense, unbearable pain. He felt for his holster, hoping that his one chance of escape would still be there, but all he felt was the empty, dense air. No gun, no knife, no hope; that was the world he lived in. His legs collapsed under him, dropping him onto the hard, dusty concrete floor. The pain in his leg flared up again, and the man winced in pain. He sat up and looked at the scar, trying to make out the damage with the little rays of light. The scar was deeper than he had seen before, and it was bleeding immensely. He quickly ripped off the little piece left of his cape and wrapped it around the scar in an effort to stop the blood gushing out of it. Why was there so little left of the cape? It had been glorious, flowing down unto the ground. Where had it all gone? The thought crossed the adventurer’s mind, but he disregarded it, considering it to be unimportant, and he laid back down in an attempt to ease the pain, to let his wound heal as he waited.');
		message.channel.send('Adrian closed his eyes and became encased in his thought again. “How did I get here, what had I done wrong?” Adrian closed his eyes and became encased in his thought again, mumbling them aloud to keep himself awake, “Should have shot the bastard as soon as I…”');
		message.channel.send('He ceased his mumbling, deciding that it was better for anyone that might have been watching or listening not to hear. The adventurer’s thoughts immediately drifted off to ideas of escape: how, where, when? They soared through the man’s mind, but none of them seemed to stick, be it because of his brain’s constant blackouts that still occasionally occurred, or because any legitimate plans that did come to his mind were quickly deemed impossible. The man lay, crumpled up, in almost complete hopelessness, simply awaiting whatever fate was to now come his way, praying for little more than death. Fate, on the other hand, had no intent of giving him a quick death.');
		message.channel.send('A loud knocking came from the door, but Adrian refused to stand or even pay attention to the knocking, instead letting himself be embraced by darkness and hopelessness. The knock came a few more times, and after discovering that his knocks were not disturbing the adventurer, whoever was outside knocking spoke. ');
		message.channel.send('“Head Doctor Cassius wants to speak with you. You can comply, or be hung as a sentence from the Council of the Republic,” the soldier spoke through a tiny gap in the door. The adventurer sat up, bringing more pain to his scar, and said to the soldier with the little strength he had left, “Let him speak with me.” The wishes of death had left his mind; the only way to escape his captors would to negotiate with them, which, at worst, would at least prolong his life for another few hours.');
		message.channel.send('The door slowly creaked open, and the light blared through and blinded the adventurer, who immediately put his hand in front of his eyes in order to shield them. The door hit the wall with a thud, and the loud, echoing sound of the Doctor’s metallic boots came closer. The doctor walked inside and leaned himself against the wall, “My my, Adrian, you seem injured,” he said as he stared down at the man, taking notice to the hidden scar on his leg.');
		message.channel.send('“I guess A049 decided it wouldn’t be enough to simply leave you here… apologies.” The Doctor’s eyes were hidden behind his mask, shiny pieces of glass letting him see out but not the adventurer in, instead the adventurer saw only himself in the reflection, only his eyes, filled with a hellish, burning hatred that overshadowed over even the deep, eternal fear.');
		message.channel.send('“Why are you meeting with me? Why not just kill me?” the man grunted in the strongest voice he could muster, risking his fate, again wandering over to a wish for nothing more than death. ');
		message.channel.send('“Kill you?”, the Doctor laughed heartily at the man, letting loose a metallic roar that echoed in the cell, “No, no, that is… too good a fate for you. Death… too simple.”');
		message.channel.send('“Then what are you going to do with me, you bastard!?” the man spat at the Doctor in anger and fear, as he let free his metallic laugh once more. The Doctor kneeled on one knee in front of the man, staring right into his eyes, almost letting the beak of his mask touch his nose, saying, “That’s classified. You’ll see eventually, but for now? I am the one asking the questions,” he backed up from the adventurer and began pacing around the room. “');
		message.channel.send('Now,” the Doctor said calmly as he took out a large needle from his pocket, “how did you get the note from the Executor? I managed to contact him a few hours ago, and I was told that he had no knowledge of that paper.”');
		message.channel.send('“That’s none of your business you-”');
		message.channel.send('“Ah ah ah, language. Now I am afraid that if you refuse to comply,” the Doctor places the syringe near the adventurer’s arm, “we will be forced to… destroy you, just like we did A049. Make you forget everything but hatred and despair. You don’t want that, now do you?”');
		message.channel.send('“For you to make more monsters?”');
		message.channel.send('“Monsters?” Cassius asked, taken back by the question, “They are not monsters, they are creations of science! Works of genius! Mr. Bauer, realize that I am not an inhumane man. Anything I do works towards the good of science, towards the good of my people! I am a family man, you know. I have a wonderful wife and the sweetest little girl. What do you have? A sad little home in Seditionem Ventum”');
		message.channel.send('“Who would marry you? A psychopath?” he chose not to answer the question because he knew he was right.');
		message.channel.send('“She was a good woman, really. It’s a shame she passed. But life goes on, does it not? And I assure you, Mr. Bauer, my work goes to make sure it does.”');
		message.channel.send('“You call this life? What you create isn’t-”');
		message.channel.send('He was cut short as there was a loud banging coming from outside the door: another soldier, knocking to get the Doctor. “Sorry to bother you sir, but there’s a uh… situation,” the soldier said. There was a short moment of silence, where the man, whose senses were at last coming to and his hearing becoming as sharp as it usually was, could here distant screams and the roars of gunfire, as well as loud, metallic footsteps, coming constantly closer, like an old army in steel boots. “What do you mean a situation!?” the Doctor stopped pacing and went to the soldier at the door, “The rebels, or whatever the hell they call themselves, taking the station by storm. We have them blocked them off at the second airlock, but it won’t last long. We’re outnumbered, sir,” the soldier spoke excitedly, and there was a definite look of fear in his eyes.');
		message.channel.send('The Doctor quickly put away his syringe and took out a pistol from his holster, “I am sorry, Mr. Bauer, but it looks like our time together has come to a close,” he pointed the gun at the adventurer’s chest, and as the distant sound of gunfire continued to grow near, he fired the gun, catching him in the side of his chest; a painful strike, but not a lethal one if it was treated correctly. Pain shot around the man’s body, making him feel as though he was being torn into shreds from the inside out. His vision blurred, and the echoing, deep sound of the revolver’s shot filled his ears. His eyes began to tear up, but through what he could still see he saw the soldier and the Doctor exiting the cell, and could hear them talking, though he was not able to decipher what it was they were saying. The gunshots came closer and closer, clearly following the Doctor, but soon came to a close, and all that remained were the metallic footsteps.');
		message.channel.send('A few of the rebel fighters walked past the cell, and the adventurer tried to call out to them, but his cries were too quiet and weak. He began to slowly close his eyes, accepting his fate, his death. Then the footsteps came astonishingly close to him, and he could see an outline of a tall man in military armor standing in front of him, trying to get his attention. Leave me alone, let me die, the man thought, but to no avail. He could see the figure gesture towards his friends, and heard a loud yell, saying, “He’s still alive, here! Someone get a doctor!” The adventure lightheartedly chuckled inside at the call for a doctor, for it was a doctor that had done this to him. He saw a few more soldiers enter the room, one, two, three, his vision was too blurred to tell anymore, and he closed his eyes in hope that he would be able to sleep as they carried him away. He felt soft, leather gloves on his shoulders and legs, which slowly picked him up and put him unto a stretcher. “Just a little gunshot wound, nothing a trip to ol’ Ainsworth won’t fix,” one of the rebels said, “But your leg… that… oh. I think that-”');
		message.channel.send('The soldier speaking stopped and shouted something, but he couldn’t understand it with his dulled senses. He was probably calling for a doctor. Adrian remembered Ainsworth, an old colleague of his, one of the head figures in the movement against the Republic. Anton Ainsworth, the thought wandered around in his head, but immediately left as he began to consider other things: What was he going to do with himself after he recovered? Return to life back in Seditionem Ventum? He couldn’t just leave the rebellion, he was one of the most important figures in it, but he didn’t wish to continue this lifestyle. He wanted nothing more than to be out of Michigan, somewhere peaceful, quiet, where he could grow old and die a simple man: a farmer, a repairman, something like that, but life wasn’t that simple.');
		message.channel.send('The sound of shoes pounding against the concrete, sprinting towards the man, became noticeably louder. He opened his eyes for a second, and saw a soldier salute a man dressed in all white, who carried a large bag in his hand. Before he could tell what it was, his vision blurred out again, and he was left with nothing but his hearing to guide him. The man in white spoke, an unrecognizable voice to the adventurer, but it spoke calmingly, saying, “Mr. Bauer, what a mess you’ve gotten yourself into. Still, nothing a few band-aids won’t heal eventually, eh?” The adventurer coughed, his throat burned from thirst, and he winced in pain yet again. The doctor reached into his pocket and pulled out a syringe filled with blue liquid, and he flinched at the sight of it, “No worries,” he said as he saw the adventurer’s movement, “just a simple procedure.” The doctor stabbed the syringe into his arm, and the adventurer’s senses began to dull, as his eyes slowly closed, and did not blink back open.');
		message.channel.send('“Alright, I think he’s waking up,” another unknown voice said. The adventurer shook his head with the little strength he had and lazily started to open his eyes. There were two figures dressed in white lab coats in front of him, but he couldn’t make out their faces with his still-blurred vision.');
		message.channel.send('“Mr. Bauer? Mr. Bauer!?” one of the doctors asked intently as he stared down at the adventurer, who began to slowly sit up from his comfortable, cloth bed. He looked around him: he was in a plain white room, which had clearly seen some damages in the past but it appeared that whoever was currently in control of this place- currently in control of him- had fixed it up quite well. Why was it so familiar? He sat up completely, his legs still outstretched upon the bed, though they were hidden under a small, white blanket, with a red lining of linen. “Where am I?” he said calmly, with an almost threatening tone, as though he would grab the necks of the doctors if they didn’t respond quickly enough. “Easy now, we’ll explain everything to you soon,” the doctor on the left said, as the one on his right walked over to a small table on the side of the room. The adventurer kicked off the blanket and stared at his leg where the scar had been. Where his calf used to be, there was a short, thick, dark silver, metal rod, with wires and circuits hanging out of it, and a long wire connecting to a metal brace that clinged to the back of his thigh.');
		message.channel.send('“What have you done to me?” the adventurer asked the doctors, very tense in his movements, now speaking openingly threateningly. “There was nothing else we could do. The cut was too deep- it had been permanently paralyzed. We wanted to leave it be, let you limp with a cast and be free of duty, but General Reynolds demanded we do, said you were “too good of an asset to lose,” the doctor said calmly, now pacing the room around the adventurer’s medical bed, “I’d take that as a compliment. God knows she’d be willing to let any of us die or get crippled and could throw it off to the side as though we were just a damned Republic soldier.” The adventurer shook his head in hatred and an acceptance of defeat, saying only, “Jane never changes, does she?”');
		message.channel.send('The two doctors chuckled slightly, and nodded their heads in agreement, as though they feared that the General would come after them herself if they said something against her. The adventurer turned his body and let his legs slide off the bed and touch the ground, sitting up. He was wearing an old, white shirt, which was mostly clean besides the occasional blood stain, and a pair of shorts which cut off just where his knee was; just where the robotic leg began. He took his hand and ran it along his new limb: the metal was cold and smooth, with nothing but one or two red wires coming out of it, connecting to a metal brace on his upper leg, and he suddenly winced at the sight of it. It was so familiar, and the memory poked at him angrily: the poor man on the operating table, turned into a machine by that clinically insane doctor, not even a fate that one of those Republic soldiers deserved. Whatever the thing was on his leg, it was not technology of the Resistance.');
		message.channel.send('“This… thing… on my leg, it’s not Cassius’ machinery, right?” the adventurer asked with a worried look on his face;  he wanted nothing that menace made to touch him, in fact he wanted nothing more than to see him lying dead. “I’m afraid it is, Mr. Bauer. It was the only technology at hand, and it was in quite good condition when we found it,” one of the doctors told him as he walked back over towards the bed and extended a hand as though to help the adventurer up. Instead of accepting his offer, he smacked the hand away with the most force he had used in days, “I’d rather be dead than have something that monster made attached to my leg!” he shouted in anger, receiving only mumbled responses from both his doctors, both saying something along the lines of, “Orders are orders”.');
		message.channel.send('The adventurer stood up out of the bed, walking on his new, robotic leg almost perfectly, though still tripping or almost falling once or twice. He looked around for a moment, then reached towards a cabinet, searching for something. “Where is it?” he said as he ripped open a cabinet. only finding some medical and robotic supplies, “Where the hell did you take it you bastards!?” He yelled at no one and nothing, screaming out in anger, searching for the one piece he had left of his mother, a short blade he had dubbed “Vengeance”, with a sharp tip and a few words engraved into the handle, “I love you and I will protect you.” The last words he heard from his mother before- he quickly shoot the memory out of his mind, and a single, small tear escaped his eye and slid down his face, dropping unto the floor. He held his hand to his face and wiped away anything left of his sadness and sprinted towards the door. It had been left wide open, but the adventurer had not gazed at it until now.');
		message.channel.send('He held his hand against the side of the door and gazed outside at the station, suddenly realizing why the room was so recognizable to him: it was the Plague Doctor’s “hospital”, the one where he created A049. There was a hand on his shoulder, coming from behind him: the doctor from before. In the other hand was a small suitcase, seemingly quite light. The hand left his shoulder as the adventurer turned to face the man, who in turn backed up a step in fear. “You have orders to return to Seditionem Ventum. Issued by General Reynolds herself,” he said cautiously, as though he were scared that he would anger the adventurer, and held out the suitcase for him to take. The adventurer took the case carefully and inspected it’s exterior thoroughly, then slowly beginning to open it. The contents of the case were somewhat limited: a black leather jacket with faded brown outlines, a small revolver filled with bullets, a pair of jeans, a gas mask, another smaller box, and two metal toed boots.');
		message.channel.send('He placed the case on the ground and took out the jacket and threw it over his shoulders, then took out the jeans and slid them on over his shorts. He slid into the shoes, put his new revolver into one of his pockets, and stared into the shiny glass eyes of the gas mask. In it he saw himself for the first time in what felt to him like years, but not the same man that he saw in the mirror the day he walked into Antonia Street Station: a deep scar ran across his face, running from his left eyebrow to the edge of his lip; he saw a man with no emotion in his eyes, no driving fire or hope, only hatred and fear: he was no longer an adventurer, but a survivor. He turned the mask around and strapped it to his face, then drew his attention to the final item in the case: a small, wooden box. He took it and showed it to the doctor, who still stood at the door, waiting, “What is this thing?” the adventurer asked him.');
		message.channel.send('The doctor simply waited and said, “Open it.” He did as he was told, and he at last found what he had been searching for, and a small hint of hope returned to his eyes. “Thank you,” the adventurer sputtered at the doctor as he tried to hide his tears. He put the blade into his opposite pocket and began to walk towards the surface.');
		message.channel.send('“Sorry sir, station’s on lockdown,” the man in scavenged military armor lazily told the adventurer as he walked towards the airlock at the edge of the station. The guard wore a gas mask, similar to that worn by the adventurer himself, and stood up straight and tall, though was clearly tired, perhaps even injured, and did not wish to be there. “Says who?” the adventurer snapped back angrily. “Captain Clark, direct orders to keep the airlock to the surface sealed for a week until we are confirmed clear. Anyone attempting to open or escape the airlock will be terminated, so I advise you step back,” the guard lazily took out his rifle from behind his back, merely as protocol; he knew who the adventurer was, but he knew that if he didn’t he would be punished by his superiors, “Sorry sir, but I’m afraid the only way back to Seditionem Ventum is through the southern tunnel.”');
		message.channel.send('The adventurer simply nodded in response and turned away in defeat, knowing that despite his high rank among the Rebellion, Captain Clark was still above him and that he couldn’t just disobey a direct command. But even as such, he still needed to get back to Seditionem Ventum, though it wasn’t the orders that were given to him that drove him there. The adventurer stood on the edge of the station and hopped down unto the southern tracks, feeling a sudden dampness in the soles of his boots. There tunnel was pitch black ahead of him, and it clearly lead downwards, and there was water that came up, hardly even up to the tip of his shoe. On the side of the tunnel opposite the station, there were two men, both old and ragged, worn by time and age, each carrying a small sack of belongings and a long rod. Behind them was what appeared to be a rusted motorboat, with an engine that must have fallen apart and been repaired numerous times by the looks of it, and a hull that doubtlessly had sprung countless leaks. The adventurer walked over to them, slowly and casually, removing his gas mask as to be more polite and formal: despite his hellish times in the Doctor’s chambers, his etiquette had still not been lost.');
		message.channel.send('“Excuse me, but where are you two heading?” the adventurer asked with a higher pitched, politer voice, one he had not used since he last spoke to his mother, years ago. Being closer to them, he could see that they were both covered in ash and dirt, as well as dark gloves that were stained in inhuman blue blood, and with clearer vision in his eyes, the poles turned from useless sticks into fishing rods. One of the men turned around, holding a lantern, and looked intently at the adventurer, speaking in a deep, old voice, clearly scarred and torn by cigarettes and alcohol, “Whatchu want?” He spoke in a very stern voice, as though he wished for the adventurer to be gone and out of his sight as soon as possible so that he and his colleague could continue with whatever work they were doing before his arrival. “I need a ride, down the Antonia-Academy Line,” the adventurer said in his polite tone, clearly trying to keep the goal of his journey discreet, as he did not know if these old men were sympathizers with the Republic that were merely journeying through Antonia Street Station as a midway station, or as a stop to get repairs to send their boat on another trip into the dark abyss of the eternally and hellishly dark and empty subway system.');
		message.channel.send('“Well what do we get out of it? We’ll take you as far as Chilltop Station, that’s our last stop,” the other old man replied, in a seemingly younger, though just as agitated voice, “We’re just about to set off. Get in or rot in this station.” The men were clearly not happy about the Rebellion controlling the station, and Chilltop was a Republic controlled station, they were most likely Republic sympathizers, but the station was to be locked down for another week, and there was no other way to the surface. The adventurer hopped into the boat quickly, anxious to be on his way, yet fearful about what fate lay for him inside the tunnel. The two men began to push the boat deeper into the water as the tunnel began to slope downwards, and once it was deep enough in to move by the motor, they both hopped in at sat next to each other, facing the adventurer in silence. The one with the lantern sat it down next to him, in between him and his friend, and pulled a switch that started the motor. The engine spat some dark liquid and smoke for a moment, then sputtered and came to life, pushing the adventurer and his new comrades deeper into the darkness.');
		message.channel.send('After a few minutes of hearing nothing but the spitting of the motor and seeing the darkness of the tunnel, only lit by the dim lantern of the fisherman, the adventurer finally spoke, “So where are you two headed off to?” The two men glanced at each other briefly, then the seemingly older one whispered something into the ear of the younger one in a very suspicious manner that the adventurer merely overlooked. “We’re fishermen, if you couldn’t tell,” the younger one said politely yet harshly, as though not to anger the adventurer but to end the conversation, as he gestured towards their fishing rods, “We were making a sales trip down the Antonia-Academy Line, and were heading back to our homes at Chilltop as you came over to us.” So that proves it then, these men were from the Republic, though if they were sympathizers or simply were forced to live under them because of the Republic’s imperialist nature was uncertain. The adventurer shuffled in his seat, moving one hand towards the pocket where his revolver was hidden, just in case what he feared worst was to happen.');
		message.channel.send('Another few minutes of silence followed the short conversation as the slope finally ended, bringing them so close to the ceiling that if one were to stand up in the boat he would hit his head on the concrete roof. The adventurer decided to test the waters again with the two fisherman, saying, “So you live under the iron fist of the Republic? And how do you find that?” The two men began to speak at the same time, but the older one cut the other one off quickly with his louder, dominant voice, saying, “We find it rather… how do I say it… joyous? Enjoyable? Something like that, you understand what I mean. Hence why we were so quick to turn back once we saw what Antonia Station had become.” The adventurer kept this in the back of his mind, trying to drag information out of the two men, “Really?” he said in the same, calm tone as he had used earlier, “I’m not a Rebel, mind you, but I don’t exactly take a liking to Cassius’ inhumane experiments.” The two men showed clear aggravation on their faces, yet tried to hide it best they could in order to be somewhat polite.');
		message.channel.send('“So what have you two heard about the escape of Adrian Bauer?” the adventurer said after he realized that the old men had no intentions of responding to his insults against the Republic. “Yes. Bastard deserves to be shot. If only the Republic would let us join their military, we would be out hunting for him instead of catching these damn fish. Or at least I would be,” the younger one responded with eyes full of anger and hatred, clearly not only angry at the adventurer, but also at the older man.');
		message.channel.send('The adventurer shuffled himself in his seat again, somewhat worried, but the older man grinned and opened a box that was laid out in between the seats. “I do apologize for my brother’s tenseness,” the man said as he opened the box and took out three bottles of beer and handed one to his brother, “He always gets like this around strangers. Here, please, take this.” The adventurer kept one hand on the holster while moving the other to take the beer, and flicking off the cap with one thrust of his thumb. He took one sip out of the beer, it was strong in alcohol, with a sweet taste, yet such a strong one that the adventurer closed his eyes and shook his head as he swallowed it. “Good stuff, where’s it from?” he said in response, driving the conversation away from the disputed topic of the Republic. The younger one simply shrugged and the older man spoke lazily after take a sip of his own drink, saying, “We don’t know where it came from, we just bought a couple boxes of the stuff off a traveling merchant back at Antonia Station a few days ago. Shame the poor bastard got shot in the head a little while after.”');
		message.channel.send('“Serves him right,” the younger one said with the same look in his eyes, “Bastard needed to pay his debt, it’s his problem if he can’t do that. I never liked him, too much of a rebellious look about him.” Their conversation was cut short suddenly by a loud noise coming from the water beneath them, at which the adventurer nearly jumped out of his seat. “No worries,” the older man, noticing the adventurer’s fear, calming him slightly, “It won’t attack us, we’re in the boat. But the second anyone leaves this thing,” the old man stopped speaking and merely did the old fashioned finger-gun-to-head movement, “Dead.” The adventurer nodded slightly and returned to his calmed position and took another large sip of the bottle of beer, which, much to his surprise, he had already almost finished. His vision had started to blur a bit from all the alcohol, but it was nothing that would do any damage; at worst he might have to glance overboard for a moment and barf. After another minute of silence, the adventurer realized that the conversation was not going to resume, and out of boredom, he pulled his knife out from his pocket and began staring at the words engraved into the handle: I love you and I will protect you.');
		message.channel.send('He omitted a quiet sigh of sigh of relief, letting his mind be filled with the few memories he still had of his mother, not all of which were the most joyous, yet the mere thought of her put joy in his mind. He glanced up briefly to see what his hosts were doing: both of them were now facing each other, occasionally glancing at an blood and dirt stained piece of paper; the older of them held a knife in their opposite hand, the other a small revolver made of scrap metal. The younger one must have noticed the adventurer’s glance, as he made a gesture towards the old man and pointed at him, pointing his gun towards the adventurer. The adventurer, not knowing how else to react, continued looking down at his knife that sat in his lap innocently, while he reached into his opposite pocket, the one that held his own revolver. “You know it really is quite strange, how similar you look to this Adrian Ba-” the younger kid’s sentence was quickly cut short as a bullet was sent straight through his face, going straight through his nose and rebounding against the tunnel halls, unleashing a hellish echo.');
		message.channel.send('The dead one’s body hit the boat with a loud thud that rocked the ship, letting a small bit of water in, but not enough to capsize it. Before the older one could even get up, the adventurer leaped out of his seat, shot him straight through the middle of his chest, right where his lung would be, and kicked him overboard before his crashing fall could capsize the boat. The adventurer took up the lantern and looked over towards the side of the boat where he had kicked the man, just to make sure he wasn’t going to come back aboard. There was a large red stain in the water by where the corpse of the man had landed, but before long, a massive eel shaped thing with a massive jaw came and pulled the corpse down into the hellish oblivion below. The adventurer omitted a sigh of relief, and sat back down in his seat, wiping the blood stains off his new jacket and holstering his gun back in his pocket.');
		message.channel.send('The adventurer sat forward in his seat, looking through the box of his hosts’ goods. The box was wooden and old, filled to the brim with an assortment of scrap and paper and beer bottles, next to which lied the stained picture, facing down, which the two fishermen held before they lashed out at him. He picked it up with two fingers and twisted it over in his hand, revealing a small, blurry picture of himself, with large text above reading: Adrian Bauer, Wanted Dead for Treason Against the Republic. He looked at the picture for a moment, noticing the large scar that still ripped his face in half: the picture must have been taken while he was in captivity, after the Doctor’s monstrosity gave him his scars. He stared at the picture for a moment more, then crumpled it up and threw it over the side of the boat in a violent rush of anger, and continued searching through the box. More beer, an empty rifle clip, many other items of the sort clotted up the box, concealing an old, leather laced book.');

The adventurer, finding quite an enjoyment for writing himself, quickly put the book and pen inside a small flap inside his jacket. He took himself away from the box, and looked up: the ceiling had begun to slope back up again; he had almost arrived at Chilltop. He strapped on his gas mask, and waited as the deep sounds of the engine brought him through the darkness, to his next destination.');
		message.channel.send('The boat hit the concrete floor of the tunnel with a loud thud. This was as far as it would take the adventurer. He stood up quickly and hopped out of the boat, in a very casual yet slick movement, taking the lantern from the boat with him, as the walk to Chilltop was still at least another mile. His boots hit the water with a loud splash that echoed through the halls, and the water went up to his ankles, filling his boots and wetting his socks disgustingly. He held the lantern in his left hand, and with his right he drew his pistol: a path between warring stations was not a safe one. The adventurer began to walk slowly, letting his echoing, splashing footsteps fill the infinitely dark and hellish tunnel. With each step, the water began to lessen and lessen, and it continued to do so for a long time, perhaps even an hour.');
		message.channel.send('Much to the adventurer’s surprise, there were few Republic guards at the entry to the station, only one man standing at a machine gun post behind a few sandbags, who merely nodded at the adventurer and let him pass. Chilltop was the poster boy of the Republic, so to speak. Open vendors and salesmen and cults, you could buy whatever you desired. On the surface, it looked like a perfect haven, but if one dug down deep enough they could truly see the Republic pulling all the strings, asking those who did not pay their overpriced taxes to come in for “questioning”, well they were only being taken to the side to be shot discretely so that another, more loyal man could take his or her place, a station captain that would shoot anyone in the head that questioned his authority. But the adventurer had no thoughts of digging deep enough to uncover that, only to walk in and walk out. He climbed an old wooden set of stairs that creaked with every movement he made, and stepped onto the station. It shone brightly with candles and electric lights, shops and stores all set up and open, lining the halls of the decayed station. Some offered junk, some offered food, truly anything a man desired could be bought at Chilltop. Anything but freedom.');
		message.channel.send('As he walked along the station, the salesmen began to beckon out at him, shouting numerous calls, “Fish! Get your fish!” , “Ammo! Guns! Knives!” , “Scrap metal, fresh from the yards up north!” They all competed to yell over each other, creating a loud sound that dulled any other noise, each calling out to everyone who passed, focusing on one man, then focusing on another after they realized that he was only walking past. Republic guards paced back and forth, minding their own business and paying no attention to the businessmen that filled their station. The station was so full of movement, so crowded, the adventurer nearly had to push his way to get towards the exit, and the crowd only became denser as he drew closer to it. As he came closer to the exit, the crowd began to thin, the people becoming less so the rich, happy men that they once were, but instead a sad, poor bunch, selling what little they had managed to scavenge outside. The Republic guards were more clear here, taking any that seemed to stink up the station or made their own home in a little corner of the station, dragging them off by the arms, covering their mouths to hide their shouts of despair. The adventurer passed most of these occurrences; as much as he hated to see these innocents taken away like this, there was nothing he could do about it. Taking action was a death wish.');
		message.channel.send('There was one of them that caught his eye. A little girl, no older than thirteen, sitting against a wall, in an old blue dress, seemingly untorn yet covered in ash and dust and small spots of blood. She sat with her head in her hands, crying, letting only a few tears flow past her face and unto the dark, concrete floor. The adventurer went up to her, thinking of it as a final chance to be a good man without spilling the blood of his enemies. “Hey, kid?” he asked as he sat down next to her, “Are you okay?” The girl glanced up at him with the corner of her eye, her face red and wet from tears, and immediately covered herself back up. “No,” she said, still sobbing. “Where are your mom and dad?” the adventurer said, hoping to console her. “Dead,” she said, clearly lying. After a moment of silence she noticed that the adventurer could see through her lies, and she lifted her head up a bit, easing her tears. “I… I ran away. I couldn’t take them anymore!” she said in a quiet voice, yet one that almost sounded as though she were shouting for help, but her little voice couldn’t manage to do so through all the tears, “But they’re going to come after me! And they’ll take me back and he’ll hit me again! No, no, no!” The girl put her face back into her hands and continued sobbing. The adventurer put his hand on her shoulder, and the girl, though clearly surprised by this act of kindness, did not wince or try to take him off, but instead embraced his sudden compassion.');

The adventurer simply nodded and stood up, offering his hand down to her in order for her to do the same, which she promptly took and held firmly with her hand. Standing up, she was only as tall as the man’s chest, needing to stare almost straight up in order to see his face. The girl held his hand, and the two continued to walk out the station.

		message.channel.send('The walk to Seditionem Ventum was only a bit longer, and the sun was already coming down upon the horizon. It gleamed in Adrian’s gasmask, and the shadows of the two were cast long behind them. The city was old and forgotten, most of the buildings in ruins or just completely flattened. The street was covered in rubble, some from the skyscrapers above, other from the streetlights and cars that used to light up the now motionless city. The sky was blue and clear, with the stars burning bright and the moon beginning to shine behind them as the sun set. There was the occasional roar from a distant creature, a ear twisting screech from someone being slaughtered far away, yet they all kept their distance; this road was safe, for whatever reason. Everyone and everything simply stayed away from it, as though it were totally pointless, and the adventurer, throughout his many trips to and from the city, had learned to take advantage of that. Another one of the beasts roared, slightly closer, but it had no effect on the adventurer and his newfound friend. They continued walking, and the city began to fade behind them, tall skyscrapers turning into short houses and apartments, which soon became scarcer and scarcer, being separated by trees and gardens. A set of footsteps could be heard, walking almost in synchronization with them, but they were not human steps, the metallic clink of the claws banging against the concrete floor so a nearby building. It howled again, still drawing closer, and this howling brought with it more of the clawed footsteps. ');

She hid herself behind him, hugging his leg, and they both stood motionlessly as the metallic steps drew closer. He aimed his gun up and shot into the air, hoping to drive the animals away. The shot echoed through the abandoned streets, and Carla winced at the sound of it, but soon after looked out from behind Adrian’s leg. The footsteps stopped for a moment, followed by one howl, then a second,then a third, then more and more, at least a dozen. The adventurer took the girl with one hand and put her over his shoulders. She was light, not enough to stop him from running, but enough to throw him off for a second. They stood in this still position for what, to them, felt like years. There was a loud thud that came from behind them, the sound of something hitting the old dirt covered road. He turned around almost immediately, and in front of him stood a large, for legged creatures. It’s head resembled that of a dog, with large teeth and stream of thick, white drool coming out of it’s mouth. The figure resembled a dog, but it was much larger than a dog should be, bigger than an average man, with longer, more muscular legs. “Cover your eyes,” the adventurer said sternly, as he pointed the gun towards the creature, but did not fire. The girl hid her eyes, shoving her face into the side of man’s head, and the creature slowly began to walk towards the two. It let out a deep, aggressive growl, and couched down as though it were about to leap. Another gunshot sounded out of the adventurer’s gun, and the dog fell to the ground with a noticeably loud thud, as a small pool blue blood appeared beneath it.');

There was another thud, like the one before, and a few more of the dogs’ loud calls followed the two of them closely. Another one of the beasts leaped towards them, but the adventurer strafed to the side quickly enough for it to miss them, but it’s claws still scratched his shoulder and tore through the jacket, leaving a three-clawed scar on his shoulder. The adventurer, without a second thought, took his pistol and shot the dog in the chest, a shot not strong enough to kill it, but powerful enough to paralyze it until something swooped in and ate it. His legs ached, they hadn’t moved this quickly in ages, but he knew that the beasts wouldn’t just stop chasing them. His legs gave out, not so much that he fell to the ground, but he could no longer run or sprint, or hardly even walk. The dogs stopped a few yards behind him, almost as though they were worried that he was laying a trap for them. He turned around, and picked up the girl from his shoulder and put her on the ground. He took out his pistol and opened the clip, only one bullet left. There were five creatures ahead of him. He took the gun and shot the closest one to him as it let loose a loud cry, and he slammed the gun back into it’s holster and took out the knife with the other. ');

Another one howled, and the adventurer gestured for the girl to start running away; if he were not to make it out alive, she should. The adventurer began to step back, with the girl a few steps behind him, as she had not run away. The dogs growled at each other, all three of them, not following the adventurer and his companion. They began backing away faster, and the dogs merely growled at them.

The richer men in town, those who served in the Rebellion, usually, were able to live in more formal, cleaner houses, with steel that had been remade and cleaned, with clean windows with cloth curtains that were usually closed. Old men sat on their chairs outside their house, some playing with an old guitar and singing an old tune, others telling their grandchildren stories and tales of what had happened long ago. Guards patrolled the streets, some picking up conversations with the locals and sometimes even the visitors, others keeping to themselves and shooing away anyone that came towards them.

He opened the door, the room was nearly empty aside from a table and three chairs in the middle, and a bed near the back. There was a lamp on a side table, with a large box next to it, and the lamp was still on. “I’m sorry, there’s only one-” the adventurer started off, immediately interrupted by her. “It’s fine,” she exclaimed, and immediately hopped into the bed, a wide grin across her face. The man sighed, one of happiness, the same type the girl showed, they merely showed this joyfulness in a different fashion. He took out the book and the pen from his earlier trip, opened to the first page, and let his thoughts flow.');
		message.channel.send('“This war has scarred me deeply, across my face and through my heart. It took my mother, my father, my home, everything I held dear to me. This girl,” the adventurer wrote as he turned to see her behind him, laying in bed, silent and asleep, that smile still drawn across her face, “so innocent. Happy. She loves me like a father simply for taking her under my wing. But I don’t want to take her in, my life is too dark, upsetting. She has such a chance for hers, down south in the markets of Rhode Island, or the newfounded republics out to the west. I want to end this war with my two hands, for the little girls like her. For the children. I question humanity for their actions, but there is nothing I can do. I let scars be torn and I tear some myself. And all for what? A little adventurer can’t change the tide of a war. I’m nothing but a pawn on a giant chessboard to these idiots, Jane, and that unknown military mastermind that controls this whole rebellion and his own God damned military. I know all this, yet I still can sleep sound at night. I have been fighting for seven years now, longer than almost everybody on the Council. Jane, Lucas, all of them. Sitting behind their chairs pacing back and forth between the halls of the Council of Rebellion, acting like they know what it’s like to be nothing more than a pawn for the player. On the surface I am an emotionless monster, doing nothing but killing and shooting and murdering, all in the name of this God-forsaken rebellion, but this girl? She reminds me of the things I felt so long ago, before the war. Care, compassion. Love?” the adventurer closed his entry with the question that would remain unanswered for ages to come, closed the book, then lay his head on the table and let himself drift off into a deep sleep.');
		message.channel.send('“Adrian?” the adventurer was met by a thud at his door. He was no longer asleep on his table, instead he lay on the second level of an old, rusted metal bunk bed. The voice was that of another man, of similar age to himself. He kicked the blanket off his bed and began to sit up. His robotic leg was no longer metallic, but was now instead a human leg again, one of flesh and bone. It was another dream, it must have been. The door creaked open, and a head of a boy, no older than sixteen, popped in. “Adrian?” he said with a stern look on his face, “It’s time to go.” His friend’s face was dark and blackened, his hair short, hardly even touching his ears, and he wore a bright white leather jacket, of which he had clearly just washed, as it reflected almost like a mirror.');
		message.channel.send('“Go? What? Where?” he replied, but his voice was higher and childish, not because he was trying to seem happy or immature, but because he had not yet aged.');
		message.channel.send('“Home. Get your stuff,” his friend closed the door and seemingly walked away. The adventurer turned, his bare legs dangling off the side of the bed. He hopped down, stumbling on the ground, but the ground was no longer the concrete floor of the room he had resided in before. It was the rough, coarse dirt of the wasteland. Barbed wire surrounded him, and he now held the end of a gun in his hand. Soldiers stood behind him, running forward into the gunfire. All the fire missed Adrian himself, but everyone that ran past him was shot down before they could reach the enemy lines. He did not remember when this happened, or where, but it all seemed familiar. His friend from the earlier segment of the dream lie dead beside him, mis gun cast aside with three shots straight through his chest. He looked back up, standing up completely, and in front of him stood another soldier, one of the Republic. No one else ran forward from behind him, he was the last one that stood. The soldier lifted his gun, aiming it at Adrian, but he was cut short before he could end it.');
		message.channel.send('There was a loud rasp at the door, and the adventurer woke up almost immediately. He glanced out the window, the sun had just risen, and it gleamed off the metal roofs of the other shacks. He stood up and pushed his chair in, then walked over to Carla, who was still asleep. He took a blanket from a small bedside stand and cast it over her softly, gently, then walked over towards the door to greet his visitor. He opened the door quickly, and in front of him stood another rebel guard, with lighter gear, a very young man, probably a brand new recruit. “Sir, you’re wanted in the Council immediately,” he said in a quiet, nervous voice.');
		message.channel.send('“Says who?”');
		message.channel.send('“Captain Reynolds.”');
		message.channel.send('“What for?”');
		message.channel.send('The guard shrugged, “That’s classified to me, sir. I’m just the messenger.”');
		message.channel.send('“So be it.”');
		message.channel.send('Adrian stepped outside, closing the door behind him, and walked back down the steps slowly. His house was very close to the Council Hall, only two or three shacks away. The Hall was the largest building in the city: it’s walls were made of the cleanest metal in the city, and flags were hung on poles every few feet, each one representing a different settlement that had joined the Rebellion, every one completely different from the one next to it, some dark red, others bright blue, and some purely white aside from a small detail in the middle. In the middle of the building there was a giant flag stood directly above the double doors to the Hall: the flag of the Western Rebellion itself. There was a massive, metallic looking bird with a white marking on it’s chest perched on the leftern most flagpole, seemingly staring straight at the adventurer. The bird looked sideways at him for a moment, then it’s eyes lit up yellow and it flew away, into the distance.');
		message.channel.send('The doors were opened a slight bit, enough for someone to see the immense table where the Council met, and there must not have been an active meeting, for the table was almost bare aside from a few of the head members sitting at it. Guards with large assault rifles were assigned to each door, holding them at the ready in case someone threatened the Council, and they both saluted upon seeing the adventurer. He walked inside, closing the door behind him as he did so. The Hall was a dark and single roomed, the only light coming from the occasional lantern hung on columns along the wall. In the center stood a massive table with seven seats, five for the cities that had joined the Western Rebellion, one for General Lucas Gerhardt, the head of military, and the final for Captain Jane Reynolds herself, the leader of the Western Rebellion. She wasn’t the head of the entire rebellion, there was still the military masterminds from Massachusetts that she served under, but even Adrian, a man hardly under the members of the council of the Rebellion, knew very little about them, aside from the fact that without them, their whole rebellion would have been run over by this point. Only Gerhardt and Reynolds were seated at the Council now, Reynolds at the seat farthest down, in the center of the table, while Gerhardt was in the chair to the left of her, speaking softly to her. Neither of them noticed the adventurer’s arrival. They spoke quietly, seemingly looking at an old, blood stained paper between them, probably a map, and nothing they said was audible, it appeared that they were merely mumbling gibberish. Jane looked up and noticed Adrian, and quickly folded up the map, as though there was something she wished to hide from him. “Captain Reynolds,” the adventurer said, saluting.');
		message.channel.send('“Adrian Bauer, we meet again. I wish it were in better terms but your failure to deal with Cassius is…  scarring to us, to say the least,” the captain said, as she stood up to meet him towards the entrance.');
		message.channel.send('“You think there’s something I could have done?”');
		message.channel.send('“I thought so, yes.”');
		message.channel.send('“There isn’t,” he paused, holding up his hand to stop her from speaking, “I want out. Let me out, I’ve worked under this damned rebellion for seven years, longer than either of you have! I want to leave, to be free,”');
		message.channel.send('The captain appeared to be taken aback, surprised at his sudden feelings. “So I annexed that station for nothing? You think I took that just for a territorial power? Do you have any ideas of the lives I spent? You were in there for a week!” she was almost yelling, and she paused for a moment before calming down, “You can’t just leave. I won’t let you.”');
		message.channel.send('“No, I’m leaving,” the adventurer turned around and started for the door.');
		message.channel.send('“Then what about the girl?” she shouted after him, “Leave her here and let her die as they take over? Let them take her in shackles and make her work on their damned zeppelins? Are you just gonna stay here and-”');
		message.channel.send('“How do you know about her?”');
		message.channel.send('“That’s not what matters right now. Nothing is going to matter if this rebellion falls apart, and it’ll all be because of you!”');
		message.channel.send('“I am one man on a chessboard with thousands of pawns. Find another piece.”');
		message.channel.send('“Who then? Take one of the recruits? Little kids that only serve for their freedom and to free their families? They hardly know how to aim a gun, I can’t throw them alone into the fires of the Republic, it’s a death sentence!”');
		message.channel.send('“But then isn’t it still a death sentence to me for me to do the same thing!?”');
		message.channel.send('“You’re here right now, aren’t you?”');
		message.channel.send('“With a robotic leg and a scar stretching all the way down my face!”');
		message.channel.send('“Fine then. Leave. Let them take over. We’ll just run back with what we can, hoping that they don’t come after us, leaving some behind to get captured so they don’t catch up to the rest of us. Like that little girl of yours,” the captain began to turn around, putting her focus back on Gerhardt and his map.');
		message.channel.send('“No. I won’t let you-”');
		message.channel.send('“Then help us. There’s no other way. I’m not going to kill you, nor her,” she said sternly, yet calmly, “But they will.”');
		message.channel.send('“Then I’ll deal with them myself. I’m done with your damned rebellion, you taking us like we’re nothing more than pawns on your chessboard, throwing us at the enemy like we’re nothing. I’m not nothing. And neither are they. I will fight ‘til the last drop of blood leaves my body, but I’m not your pawn anymore.”');
		message.channel.send('“Then where will you go? Run off and hope the Zeppelin searchlights don’t catch you as you and the girl make a break for it? Hopping from station to station, settlement to settlement, praying that the Republic doesn’t annex them like they did so many others?”');
		message.channel.send('“What is it you want from me?”');
		message.channel.send('“Are you staying or leaving?”');
		message.channel.send('The adventurer paused for a moment, considering the choice. “What does it matter? I want to hear out your ‘plan’ before I commit myself to another one of your damned suicide missions!”');
		message.channel.send('“It’s not a suicide mission, not for you anyway, but I can’t say more than that until you commit.”');
		message.channel.send('“When do I have to make a choice by?”');
		message.channel.send('“There’s no deadline, only the looming threat of the growing Republic. They make the deadlines, not me. I simply,” she pauses, “try to push the deadlines back a bit.”');
		message.channel.send('“Give me until the morning, I’ll make my choice then,” the adventurer stated firmly. He turned around and walked back out through the entrance, jogging, almost sprinting, to get away from there. He hated them, that damned Council, nothing more than a bunch of old men sitting in old wooden chairs playing chess, except the pieces were real men, hundreds of them, and he was only just a pawn. In his head he had already made his choice: he would go on the mission, whatever they sent him out to, and simply hope for the best. But it wasn’t just that simple. His thoughts were quickly cut short as he began walking up the steps towards his house, the girl was standing outside, with his gasmask thrown over her shoulder. She was wearing a leather jacket, like the one he wore, but it wasn’t his, it was far too small, but it was still too big for her. Under it she had the same blue dress on, but it was much cleaner than it had been the night before. She didn’t notice him at first, she was too busy staring at the Detroit skyline, entranced by the falling skyscrapers that still touched the edge of the world. He walked up beside her, leaning over the balcony, but she still took no notice him, totally entranced by the distant ruins. He looked out at the city for a moment, trying to find out what had intrigued her so much. “Those… things. Flying above the city,” she said, staring deeply into them, acknowledging Adrian’s presence but not caring enough to face him, “What are they?” “Republic zeppelins. Giant, flying blimps. Searching the cities for anything they don’t like. Massive behemoths,” the adventurer said, trying to come up with a simple response that she could understand, “Hellish things. I hate them, the Rebellion fears them.”');
		message.channel.send('“Do you?”');
		message.channel.send('“Do I what?”');
		message.channel.send('“Fear them.”');
		message.channel.send('“Fear is hard to describe. I’ve never been in one, I’ve never seen one all too close. Only once… I was wandering the streets of the city and one of their searchlights caught me. I hate them, we should send them all into the ground. So no, I don’t fear them, I guess.”');
		message.channel.send('The girl paused in silence for another moment, “My father, he worked on them. There were posters of them… scattered across his room. He never let me look at them, just told me I would see them in a few years once I was old enough to work on them. I think my mom… I don\'t think she liked them. Hated the idea of always being watched over… but it didn’t last for very long.”');
		message.channel.send('The two stared in silence for a moment. If one were to look at it, it would seem tense, but really it was a calm, peaceful moment, especially in the eyes of Adrian. The sun was still low in the sky, only slightly above the skyline, still early in the day. “Where did you get that jacket?” he said, breaking the silence.');
		message.channel.send('The girl gave away her mad grin again, and looked at the adventurer happily. “I found it in your closet, way in the back, under a couple pairs of shoes. It was old and dusted so a went and washed it in the pond over there, same with my dress,” she spun happily, showing herself off politely. The adventurer thought for a moment. Had he really been fighting in the war since he was small enough to fit a jacket the size of a little girl’s? He had lived here for eight years, since before the war started. And had he really been in the council hall that long? Long enough for the girl to wake up and find the jacket and find the pond and wash it all and dry it all and put it all on? It must have been quite a long debate he had had with the captain. ');
		message.channel.send('“I want to see what’s outside. Beyond the wall,” she broke the silence once more, “I never left that station in my entire life. And now I’m here… and I just feel like I’ve been trapped again. It’s better here than it is at Chilltop, obviously, and you’ve been better to me than my father ever was, but I still want to be free.” The adventurer sighed in despair, he didn’t know how to let her “be free” without letting her get killed, and simply put his hand on her back.');
		message.channel.send('“I’ll let you be free,” he paused for a moment, “You know I lied to you, back on our way here. About who I was. Matthew Hark doesn’t exist.”');
		message.channel.send('“I know. I asked around. While you were gone. You’re Adrian Bauer. That man wanted dead by the Republic. One of so many, but you’re at the top of all those lists.”');
		message.channel.send('“I’ve done a lot of things, Carla. I regret a lot of them, but I certainly can’t undo them. Maybe someday I can fix it all,” he said, taking his hand away and turning away, walking inside his home.');
		message.channel.send('The adventurer sat down in the chair, his stomach was rumbling; he hadn’t eaten in God knows how long. He walked over towards the fridge, and he was glad to see that it was still filled with whatever he had left in it before his adventure. He took out a handful of hard boiled eggs and a bottle of unlabeled sodas, sold to him by that old man in the market across the street from his house. He crammed one of the eggs into his mouth, almost savagely, and closed the fridge behind him as he returned to the table. He pushed the chair back and leaned back, kicking his feet onto the table as he sat back and drank, looking like a drunkard. But his feet didn’t touch the table, they instead touched a soft, leather surface. He leaned the chair forward again and took his legs off to see what it was. It was the book, though it was not at all as he had left it, and the pen was cast aside next to it. He opened it to the first page, reading over what he had wrote. It was all the same as it was before. But there was something else, at the bottom, after his last comment about the girl. It was something in a little kid’s handwriting, a sloppy mix of print and script, obviously Carla’s handwriting. The phrase was short, all it read was, “I love you to.” He smiled happily, but his smile felt forced. He felt like the girl was too good for her, too pure, too kind, too young.');
		message.channel.send('He was an old man, a savage, an adventurer, a survivor, a killer, not a father. But he had taken her in anyway, not knowing what he had gotten himself into. He was her responsibility now. He closed the book with the pen inside and put it back into his pocket, going back outside to be with his little girl again. She wasn’t at the balcony anymore, and he peered off the edge of the balcony, searching for her. She was running about in the street, happy, and laughing. So this is what his rebellion was fighting for, the joy of the children. He sat on the steps, staring at the city skyline and the zeppelins that flew above it, thinking about the thousands of things that flew through his mind. And he would have kept thinking about all that, had the screaming not started.');
